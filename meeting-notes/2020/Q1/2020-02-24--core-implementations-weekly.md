## Notes

### High Priority Initiatives

These are the high priority initiatives the team is currently working on.

#### Upcoming/Shipped Releases
@stebalien / @alanshaw

- js-ipfs `0.41.0` RELEASED! üö¢
  - Highlights: async/await & UnixFS v1.5
  - Release blog post: https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-02-13-js-ipfs-0-41/

#### Upgrade Testing Infra/Process
@nonsense / @raulk

- No update

#### Content Routing
@stebalien / @raulk / @dirkmc / @aschmahmann / @jacobheun / @alanshaw / @willscott / @aschmahmann

- Decision made on how to handle the DHT upgrade:
  - 1 DHT
  - 2 Protocols
  - New nodes accept requests from old nodes but do not add old nodes to their routing tables.
  - This should work 99% of the time once 20% of the network has updated. We'll get 5 9s once 45% of the network has updated.
  - We can pad these numbers by using DHT boosters.
- 1000 node test works.
- We have some concerns about LANs and VPNs.
- First round of AutoNAT improvements are in review.
- Dissociating routing table state from connection state is in the final stages of review.
- All go-libp2p stabilize changes (except those in the DHT itself) have been merged into master.

Metrics from the _old_ DHT on the _current_ network:

![Fetch Time](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qmep6vCACJuuP5vc4shSmQkTEt5mYXKmHkakGwXSb6yvMk/fetch-time.png)


#### Subdomain Gateway (Base32, Origin isolation)
@lidel

- subdomains
  - Writing tests
  - Subdomain gateways will land in go-ipfs 0.5.0.
    - Hopefully in js-ipfs by 0.43

- Agreement on how to ship CIDv1 has been reached.
  - CIDv1 Will land in go-ipfs 0.6.0 and js-ipfs 0.43


#### Bitswap Updates
@dirkmc

- Team Week
- Drop peers from the session if they aren't being useful.
- Improve perf of message sending debouncing logic.
- Send ourselves "simulated" DONT_HAVE messages for old peers when they don't send us a block within the expected timeout.
- js is blocked on PR review
  - @jacobheun and maybe @alanshaw to get reviews done this week

#### Stream Content-Based-Chunking Research/Improvements (go-ipfs / js-ipfs)
@ribasushi
 - Tool continues to take shape
   - lots of progress during team-week
     - Still a few probleems in stackable chunker/linker definitions
   - 2 lightning talks
   - Scheduled call with a collab to ensure their use-case is taken into account in final UI

### Other Initiatives

This is the backlog of initiatives that are either on-hold or low-priority.

#### UnixFS v1.5 (go-ipfs / js-ipfs)
@achingbrain / @ribasushi

- No updates

#### Add Performance (js-ipfs)
@achingbrain

- @aschmahmann
  - There are no new changes happening on the go-ipfs side of things (already made things ~2x faster by switching to async writes - very similar to copy-paste speed when using BadgerDB). Removing go-ipfs and myself from this initiative.

#### Distributed Signaling (js-libp2p)
@jacobheun

- Still on pause, specs and PoC are slated for Q2

#### Migration to multihash keys in blockstore (js-ipfs / go-ipfs)
@hsanjuan

### Design Review Proposals
> You want to propose something for design review.

### Blockers/Asks
> You are blocked and need to talk about it to help unblock. List it here!

### Questions
> You have questions and need them answered. List them here.

### Parking Lot
> Anything you would like to discuss that doesn't fit into any of the other categories.

### Week Update (for async review)
> Only post updates that are relevant to the IPFS Core Implementations Work. We know you do a ton more things but for this call, the focus are the implementations ‚ù§Ô∏è üåü
