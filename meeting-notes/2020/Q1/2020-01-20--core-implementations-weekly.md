## Notes

#### Upcoming/Shipped Releases
@stebalien / @alanshaw

- go-ipfs 0.4.23 RC1 is up!
  - https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/6837
- js-ipfs 0.41 CI is GREEN üíö (except interop tests) - RC hopefully this week

#### Upgrade Testing Infra/Process
@stebalien / @daviddias / @nonsense / @raulk

- @lidel added regression/smoke tests that run ipfs-webui in real Chromium:
  - go-ipfs
      - [test: E2E tests against ipfs-webui HEAD](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/6825)
  - js-ipfs
      - [test: E2E tests against ipfs-webui HEAD](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/2706/)

#### Content Routing
@stebalien / @raulk / @dirkmc / @aschmahmann / @jacobheun ??

- @aschmahmann has been working on this. Has a WIP patch locally to simplify things.
  - Implementing Disjoint Paths, the correct Kademlia query logic, working on making it pluggable so that it's easier to try different query logic.
  - This is the 1st step in improving content routing
  - Hoping to publish a public technical plan sometime next week

#### Subdomain Gateway (Base32, Origin isolation)
@lidel

- wip, drafting docs with configuration examples for common use cases 
  - Creating configuration to setup a Gateway, path based or subdomain based

#### Distributed Signaling (js-libp2p)
@jacobheun

- On hold pending the js-libp2p refactor, should be starting in the next couple weeks

#### IPNS (go-ipfs / js-ipfs)
@aschmahmann / @hugomrdias

- No updates

#### Add Performance (go-ipfs / js-ipfs)
@aschmahmann / @achingbrain

- @achingbrain is looking into pinning performance

#### Migration to multihash keys in blockstore (js-ipfs / go-ipfs)
@alanshaw / @auhau

- JS On hold because we're focused on getting async/await out the door
- Go still needs a migration, but everything else should be in place

#### Bitswap Updates
@dirkmc

- Stebalien is still reviewing [proof of concept changes](https://github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap/pull/189)
- Working on testground [test suite](https://github.com/ipfs/testground/pull/345)

#### js-ipfs/js-libp2p/js-ipld async await refactor
@achingbrain / @jacobheun / @vasco-santos / @alanshaw

- js-libp2p
  - Resolving final bugs with the browser example
  - Need to resolve an issue with pubsub in libp2p interop with go
  - Need to finalize the Getting Start Guide
  - Hoping to release this week!
- js-ipfs
  - Working on interop
    - Exchanging files works and **locally** the refactor is much faster than the current version


#### UnixFS v1.5 (go-ipfs / js-ipfs)
@achingbrain / @ribasushi

- Support for -X and recursive operations added to `ipfs.files.chmod` command: https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-mfs/pull/73

#### Stream Content-Based-Chunking Research/Improvements (go-ipfs / js-ipfs)
@ribasushi

- Almost-almost-almost finished with initial version of tool to produce DAG stats from test datasets across a range of options. ETA for this+initial writeup mid-this-week.
- Found a few mismatches between `goipfs add` and `jsipfs add` :( Failing tests coming soon

### Design Review Proposals
> You want to propose something for design review.

### Blockers/Asks
> You are blocked and need to talk about it to help unblock. List it here!

### Questions
> You have questions and need them answered. List them here.

olizilla: should we review the endevours listed in this meeting? Ruthless focus on content resolution?

consider suspending: 
- Distributed Signaling
- IPNS
- Migration to multihash keys in blockstore 

(we dont have to kill the endevour, but it seems like they are lower priority / not blocking resolution perf...)

- We're finalizing the Technical Plan and from there should be able to make a better plan of how this work will land.
  - Prioritize the work we're actively working on, and move other things to a backlog

### Parking Lot
> Anything you would like to discuss that doesn't fit into any of the other categories.

### Week Update (for async review)
> Only post updates that are relevant to the IPFS Core Implementations Work. We know you do a ton more things but for this call, the focus are the implementations ‚ù§Ô∏è üåü
