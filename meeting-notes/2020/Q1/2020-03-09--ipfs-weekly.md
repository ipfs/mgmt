**Notes**

-   Remote team
-   IPFS can be a rough conversation starter
-   What if front-end code was all you needed?
-   Front-end not going away
-   Browsers getting more powerful
-   And we have public infra
-   And edge computing is rising
-   Many words, just starting to come to focus
-   All apps are hard
-   But lamp is 30yo now
-   Front and back end, plus devops
-   Lots of breaches
-   Great local dev env, but deployment is hurty for devs
-   Million choices, million different things to learn
-   How to build web-native apps?
-   Fission building a framework for “web-native” apps
-   Building hosting too, but should run local
-   User accounts, data priv, auth
-   DNS still needed
-   And IPFS features built-in for cdn, access control, encryption
-   Making web apps more like native desktop or mobile apps
-   Web, have to push stuff to som eserver
-   For edge, mirro code, etc
-   We’re making these bits location independent
-   The dragon: LLVM
-   Compiler and runtime infra on ios
-   Leveraging js, v8, webassembly on top of ipfs
-   Nice experience w/o having to worry about devops
-   Your production server is now the network
-   Build an entire app while offline on a plane
-   Add first user account offline
-   Should work in all browsers w/o plugins
-   Webauthn
-   Lets your browser hold keys for you
-   For passwordless login
-   Built into fission sdk
-   Integration is the big thing
-   What’s built so far…
-   Web api (REST) for IPFS
-   Similar to pinning svc but we don’t think of ourselves that way
-   Pinning is least interesting
-   More like app hosting
-   Heroku addon
-   Dns automation
-   Automatically get subdomain
-   Renewal
-   Domain purchases from cmd line later
-   Cli, all in one
-   Used ipfs-deploy
-   But all over http
-   Want ot use ipfs natively
-   Devs install ipfs
-   Then fission
-   And then do everything via cli
-   \> fission up
-   Ipfs does the syncing
-   Fission register
-   Fission watch
-   Live reload
-   Updating top level dag
-   And dns txt record
-   Next:
-   pub/priv key based accounts
-   For account portability
-   Accounts can add apps
-   Have domains
-   Encryption
-   Web login (webauthn)
-   FFS fission file system
-   Identity
-   (or just below)
-   Loosely based on DIDs and verifiable credtls
-   Identity as pubkey
-   Jwt auth and macaroons
-   Can delegate across domains
-   whitepaper.fission.codes/identity
-   Similar to oauth/jwt today but decentralized
-   Based largely on google macaroons
-   RSA b/c browser support
-   Cli is edwards curve
-   FFS
-   Store dag hash in dns -> boris.fission.name
-   Today is public
-   Next is private
-   Each file in each dir has header w/ symmetric key
-   And has keys all the way below it
-   Can take subtree and share it w/ someone by sharing key
-   Key rotated on index and key exchange for symmetric keys for read
-   Write key is auth into fission svc to pin new dag
-   “Just works” is primary goal
-   Api is “store privately this file”
-   Can try drive now
-   Drive.fission.codes
-   Launched in preview in feb
-   Built on top of fission
-   Who uses dotfiles
-   App data
-   Boris.fission.name
-   Have per-app storage client side
-   Works w/ any public ipfs files today
-   Private coming
-   Image previews
-   Feels zippy
-   Built by steven, client side
-   Elm
-   Quickly iterate, easy to refactor
-   Rendermedia
-   Not open source yet, but planned
-   Get-ipfs
-   Like ipfs provider
-   Es6
-   Haskell on backend
-   Ipfs-haskell for local node or remote http
-   Hired a dev to do ipfs ignore cmd
-   Have a PR to go-ipfs
-   Please look and review
-   Want to get more files into ipfs
-   Integrations and sync
-   Eg drive on desktop but managing attachments on ghost, discourse, etc
-   Heroku + ghost + ipfs for one-click deploy
-   Heroku has no fs, so upload directly to ipfs
-   Ghost storage adapter
-   Same for Discourse
-   Discourse-ipfs-filestore
-   Get into discuss.ipfs.io?!?!
-   QUESTIONS
-   Are people using it?
-   ~200 accounts
-   Used at some hackathons
-   Origin protocol poking around for making fe portable
-   Not pushing hard on adoption until identity and private files
-   Key for having 100% client side
-   Where to contact you?
-   Can ask here<https://events.fission.name/2020/ipfs-community-call>
-   Discord chat
-   <https://fission.codes/discord>
-   https&#x3A;//talk.fission.codes forum
-   Planning to offer paid service
-   Interesting options like Filecoin
