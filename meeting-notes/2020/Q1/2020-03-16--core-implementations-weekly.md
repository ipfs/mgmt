## Notes

### High Priority Initiatives

These are the high priority initiatives the team is currently working on.

#### Upcoming/Shipped Releases
@stebalien / @achingbrain

- go-ipfs RC is a bit late. We wanted to get it out by Friday at the latest but:
  - Go-ipfs patches are still in flight.
    - Keystore refactor should be landing soon.
    - Subdomain gateway should be landing soon.
    - We have at least one more tiny bitswap patch but bitswap changes have now been merged.
    - Address filtering isn't quite working (bug introduced recently in libp2p)
  - We're still finishing up some final DHT patches, addressing some test issues, and testing in testground.
  - We should have an RC by the end of the week.
  - Timezones suck (hard to meet synchronously)
- If you have any last-minute changes to go-ipfs, now is the time to submit them _iff_ they need to make it into the release.
- Changelog initial draft: https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/6977

- js-ipfs
  - Shipping pinning improvements may not make it in this week
  - Shop bug-fix release once MFS has been fixed

#### Upgrade Testing Infra/Process
@nonsense / @raulk / @RobM
- no one present to give updates (fill in async)


#### Content Routing
@stebalien / @raulk / @dirkmc / @aschmahmann / @jacobheun / @alanshaw / @willscott / @aschmahmann

* üê≤ Hydra v0.1.0 tagged - in process of being deployed
 - balanced peer id generation (peer ids evenly distributed)
 - providing for things that peer asked for
 - prometheus metrics
 - plan is deploy version with a few heads and ramp up
* Hydra next steps:
  - Shared routing table (requires some design thinking)
  - Shared datastore (across multiple machines)
    - There is an existing, reasonably up to date postgres impl
  - https://github.com/libp2p/hydra-booster
* autonat interface solidifying - optimistically tag in next day or two
* DHT changes are mostly looking good
  - Writing more tests to better emulate the existing network
    - Currently use a small set of network topologies
    - Haven't yet scaled up to thousands of nodes on k8s
  - Aarsh is looking into some unit test issues

#### Subdomain Gateway (Base32, Origin isolation)
@lidel


- go-ipfs: 
  - ongoing review [feat: gateway subdomains + http proxy mode](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/6096)
    - addressed most, two things should land soon: `/api` handling, validation before redirect
  - `$IPFS_PATH/config` docs for new options at `Gateway.PublicGateways` can be previewed at: [feat/gateway-subdomains/docs/config.md#gatewaypublicgateways](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/feat/gateway-subdomains/docs/config.md#gatewaypublicgateways)
- ipfs-companion: http proxy/subdomain support wip, aiming for a beta release by end of week

#### Bitswap Updates
@dirkmc
- This week:
  - [Remove unresponsive peers from session](https://github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap/issues/258)
  - [Add docs](https://github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap/pull/294)
  - [Cleanup logs](https://github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap/pull/299)
- Next:
  - Testing against staging

#### Stream Content-Based-Chunking Research/Improvements (go-ipfs / js-ipfs)
@ribasushi

- go-ipfs: dag import/export
  - Design finalized, dependency changes in PR
  - Wrapping up tests / code changes in go-ipfs
  
- dagger:
  - Car export ready, waiting for above to test interop
  - Some progress on stacked chunkers interface, but not yet there :(

#### Stardust transport/discovery
@vasco-santos (not attending, Internet connection on a terrible day)

- Still waiting final reviews on examples
- Docker image and Prometheus instrumentation in preparation for deploy
  - [libp2p/js-libp2p-stardust#24](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-stardust/pull/24)

#### Rust IPFS Initiative
@aphelionz

- Phase 1.0 is _complete_ pending the submission of the milestone report
    - Phase 1.0 is project setup and conformance framework setup (ipfs/interop and interface test)
- Blog posts are also pending
- As of right now we have
   - IPFS_PATH setup - https://github.com/ipfs-rust/rust-ipfs/issues/88
   - /id API largely done
   - /version API done
   - /swarm in progress
   - /pubsub on deck
- Phase 1.2 will complete /block, /dag, /refs, /bitswap 
- Doing things that are most idiomatic to Rust now, pending decisions from PL on Blockstore (index by multihash, etc)
   - PL will have meeting in near future

### Other Initiatives

This is the backlog of initiatives that are either on-hold or low-priority.

#### UnixFS v1.5 (go-ipfs / js-ipfs)
@achingbrain / @ribasushi

#### Add Performance (js-ipfs)
@achingbrain

#### Distributed Signaling (js-libp2p)
@jacobheun

#### Migration to multihash keys in blockstore (js-ipfs / go-ipfs)
@hsanjuan

### Design Review Proposals
> You want to propose something for design review.

[Naming blocks in the datastore](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/issues/242)
- Should we switch to multihashes in the blockstore (rather than cids)?
  - @dirkmc
  - @david
  - @alanshaw
  - @stebalien
  - @ribasushi
  - @koivunej (Joonas from Equilibrium should be on this call w/r/t Rust IPFS) - joonas@equilibrium.co
  - @achingbrain
  - @aschmahmann

Note: The plan for the meeting is to make a decision, so all participants should make sure to read all the context very carefully (and there may not be time for many questions)

### Blockers/Asks
> You are blocked and need to talk about it to help unblock. List it here!

- Help Johnny update docs.
- Contribute to the release notes. https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/6977

### Questions
> You have questions and need them answered. List them here.

### Parking Lot
> Anything you would like to discuss that doesn't fit into any of the other categories.

### Week Update (for async review)
> Only post updates that are relevant 
to the IPFS Core Implementations Work. We know you do a ton more things but for this call, the focus are the implementations ‚ù§Ô∏è üåü
