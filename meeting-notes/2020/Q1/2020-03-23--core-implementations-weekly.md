#### Subdomain Gateway (Base32, Origin isolation)
@lidel

    - next merge & release stable version: [feat: *.localhost subdomain gateway support with http proxy](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/pull/853)

#### Bitswap Updates
@dirkmc

- Go performance improvements
  - Reuse message objects.
  - Avoid allocating when serializing CIDs.
- There's a [wantlist leak](https://github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap/issues/310) in go-bitswap that we need to track down before the release.

#### Rust IPFS Initiative
@aphelionz

- Phase 1.0 [Grant report](https://github.com/ipfs/devgrants/blob/c560f3134a3391083b867414ddb65615ca06155e/open-grants/ipfs-rust/reports/phase-1.0.md) submitted
- [Phase 1.1](https://github.com/orgs/ipfs-rust/projects/2) is in progress, about 1 week behind due to internal + external circumstances
    - /version and /swarm are done, /id is mostly done, /pubsub in progress
    - Mostly working with `rust-libp2p` complexities
    - refactoring caused /swarm to delay, which delayed /pubsub
    - dealing with need to refactor certain interface / interop tests
- Phase 1.2 will contain /bitswap, /refs, /block, and /dag

@stebalien is punting this discussion till April.

### Design Review Proposals
