## Notes

### High Priority Initiatives

These are the high priority initiatives the team is currently working on.

#### Upcoming/Shipped Releases
@stebalien / @alanshaw

- js-ipfs `0.41.0-rc.1` RC RELEASED! üö¢
  - Highlights: async/await & UnixFS v1.5
  - Release blog post in review:
      - https://github.com/ipfs/blog/pull/369

#### Upgrade Testing Infra/Process
@stebalien / @daviddias / @nonsense / @raulk

- v0.1 has landed
    - https://twitter.com/raulvk/status/1225147495627608064
- CI is fixed.
- A few small improvements and bug fixes to v0.1
    - Image pushing to AWS ECR
    - Configurable resource limits for pods
    - Canceling of testplan runs on interrupt from Testground client

#### Content Routing
@stebalien / @raulk / @dirkmc / @aschmahmann / @jacobheun

- [Signed Peer Records](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/issues/776) should be landing today or tomorrow
- [Don't Join DHT when behind NATs](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/issues/778) is nearly complete and should be ready for testing.
- Work is kicking off on [Disassociating routing table membership from connection state](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-kad-dht/issues/283)
  - There is some open discussion about the approach that we need to nail down
- Disjoint Path and Terminating query improvements are in testing. There are some issues with Testground speed that are causing delays here.
  - Simultaneous dials have also been a problem. We are looking at mitigating it via [conditional dial cancels](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-swarm/issues/79#issuecomment-422587405)
  - Performance looking much better, but need to test with more nodes to get a better picture of how much better we expect IPFS network performance to get


#### Subdomain Gateway (Base32, Origin isolation)
@lidel
  - go-ipfs: fixed graceful PeerID support in gateway (incl subdomains) and CLI, and subdomain tests for CIDs and PeerIDs
    - next: more tests i9(cover two proxy modes and dnslink - testing the latter is tricky to test in trully offline mode)

#### Bitswap Updates
@dirkmc
  - New Test Plans
    - [Seed Selection](https://github.com/ipfs/testground/issues/436) - verify Bitswap chooses lowest latency peers
    - [Bitswap Fuzz Test Plan](https://github.com/ipfs/testground/pull/492) + profiling
    - [Version Compatibility](https://github.com/ipfs/testground/issues/435) - verify new Bitswap and old Bitswap can talk to each other
  - Timeout Management [issue](https://github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap/issues/244) [PR](https://github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap/pull/248)

#### Stream Content-Based-Chunking Research/Improvements (go-ipfs / js-ipfs)
@ribasushi
  - More feedback incorportion and profiling, CLI interface is taking its final shape. Slight scope-alignment, updated mid-section of the task-list at https://github.com/ipfs/specs/issues/227#issue-532891529. Seriously aiming at having external-usable `v0.1` by team week


### Other Initiatives

This is the backlog of initiatives that are either on-hold or low-priority.

#### UnixFS v1.5 (go-ipfs / js-ipfs)
@achingbrain / @ribasushi

#### Add Performance (go-ipfs / js-ipfs)
@aschmahmann / @achingbrain

#### Distributed Signaling (js-libp2p)
@jacobheun

#### Migration to multihash keys in blockstore (js-ipfs / go-ipfs)
@alanshaw / @auhau / @hsanjuan

- Getting closer, unfortunately tricky as we're trying to support a reverse migration. 
  - Hoping for a v0.5.0 release with this, but it might come a bit later

### Design Review Proposals
> You want to propose something for design review.

### Blockers/Asks
> You are blocked and need to talk about it to help unblock. List it here!

### Questions
> You have questions and need them answered. List them here.

- Were there hard blockers using unix sockets when we creating the IPFS cli? (It talks over http)
  - This is in master, planned for v0.5
- Can we attain peer latency in addition to their peer-id to get a better idea of what the network looks like?
  - We could get it on disconnect
- Will we be able to use signed peer records as provider records?
  - No, they're just peer records. Signed provider records with rsa would be a lot to store. Using smaller keys could make this more feasible to support.

### Parking Lot
> Anything you would like to discuss that doesn't fit into any of the other categories.

### Week Update (for async review)
> Only post updates that are relevant to the IPFS Core Implementations Work. We know you do a ton more things but for this call, the focus are the implementations ‚ù§Ô∏è üåü

@aschmahmann
- Done:
  - Fixed dials to undialable (e.g. peers behind NATs) in DHT testground tests to more closely emulate reality (TCP connections timeout after 5 seconds)
  - Rewrote DHT test scripts to utilize testground v0.1 logging
  - Autonat support in DHT and DHT testing (upgraded from the hacky way from last week)
  - Started running small scale k8s tests
  - Hacked around TCP simultaneous connections at the swarm layer (instead of just in the tests). This approach uses more resources, but is better than just closing useful connections
- Blocked:
  - Were there any blockers? If so, which ones? Is it still blocked? Why?
- Next:
  - Gather metrics for DHT tests as they scale across various parameters (e.g. network size, bucket size, number of disjoint paths, percent undialable nodes)
  - Hopefully get DHT tests running on 1k k8s nodes
