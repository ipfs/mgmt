#### Upgrade Testing Infra/Process
@stebalien / @daviddias / @nonsense / @raulk

- Merged compositions
  - Allows you run various groups of different images
  - The images allow you to specify different versions of libp2p
- You can store assets/artifacts in an S3 bucket
- Should be ready tomorrow with v0.1 release

#### Content Routing
@stebalien / @raulk / @dirkmc / @aschmahmann / @jacobheun

- Work is kicking off for [Network Forming](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/issues/783), which we need for all DHT testground testing going forward.
  - Terminating queries and Disjoint paths are blocked by this
- Signed Peer Records is working on feedback, hoping to finish this in the next week or two
- Need someone to work on
  - AutoNAT improvements
  - Simultaneous dial bug (https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-swarm/issues/79) (lower priority)
  - Tests!

#### Subdomain Gateway (Base32, Origin isolation)
@lidel

-  still wip (needs sharness tests and [a flag for controlling Clear-Site-Data](https://github.com/ipfs/in-web-browsers/issues/157)), but  [PR](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/6096) is finalizing on subdomain config ([preview](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/feat/gateway-subdomains/docs/config.md#gateway)) 

#### Bitswap Updates
@dirkmc
  - Merged [bitswap PoC](https://github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap/pull/189)
    - Big thanks to @Stebalien for reviewing 9,000 line PR ‚ù§Ô∏è
  - Writing Testground plans
  - See [go-ipfs#6782](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/6782) for some graphs of PoC performance and outstanding tasks to get to 0.5.0
  - [Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mbFFGIIKNvboHyLn-k26egOSWkt9nXjlNbxpmCEQfqQ) about the differences between the old Bitswap and new Bitswap

#### Stream Content-Based-Chunking Research/Improvements (go-ipfs / js-ipfs)
@ribasushi
  - Continuing to work on the standalone dagger tool, incorporating performance feedback from @warpfork. Things are really coming together, but no demo yet today :/

### Other Initiatives

This is the backlog of initiatives that are either on-hold or low-priority.

#### UnixFS v1.5 (go-ipfs / js-ipfs)
@achingbrain / @ribasushi

- from @stebalien to @achingbrain: given that js-ipfs now has this... could we get this in go-ipfs?

#### Add Performance (go-ipfs / js-ipfs)
@aschmahmann / @achingbrain

- from @momack2 to @aschmahmann - could we get "old" versus "new" versus "copy" numbers for ubuntu (all on the same machine?)

#### Distributed Signaling (js-libp2p)
@jacobheun

- Should kick back off later this quarter

#### Migration to multihash keys in blockstore (js-ipfs / go-ipfs)
@alanshaw / @auhau

@hsanjuan go-ipfs: migrations and necessary changes to datastore, go-blockstore, go-filestore, go-ipfs are coming into place.

### Design Review Proposals

### Parking Lot
> Anything you would like to discuss that doesn't fit into any of the other categories.

### Week Update (for async review)
