## Notes

### High Priority Initiatives

These are the high priority initiatives the team is currently working on.

#### Upcoming/Shipped Releases
@stebalien / @achingbrain

- go-ipfs 0.5.0 on the way
  - Missing components
    - Peerstore changes
    - Noise
  - Final stages
    - QUIC
    - Bootstrapper migration
    - Gateway Subdomain Proxy
  - https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/6776
  
- js-ipfs 0.42 is upcoming
  - https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/2808

#### Upgrade Testing Infra/Process
@nonsense / @raulk

- 0.2.0 launched today.
    - https://github.com/ipfs/testground/releases/tag/v0.2.0


#### Content Routing
@stebalien / @raulk / @dirkmc / @aschmahmann / @jacobheun / @alanshaw / @willscott / @aschmahmann

- Two weeks left until the 1st RC of 0.5!
- Added an issue to include support for running both [Public and Private DHTs](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/issues/803)
  - We are looking to land this in 0.5 to avoid breaking private networks
- Discovered an issue with Signed Peer Records around needing to support dialing unsigned addresses, such as locally provided addresses. Need support for address origin, see the [proposal issue](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/issues/804) for more details
- Reliable AutoNat work is progressing well, there are a few issues that need review
- Routing Table improvements as part of [go-libp2p#779](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/issues/779) are on track
- Backwards compat support for older dht nodes, ["Multiple DHTs"](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/issues/780) should be finishing up this week

#### Subdomain Gateway (Base32, Origin isolation)
@lidel

- go-ipfs: [got proxy tunneling (HTTP Proxy mode starting with `CONNECT`) working in subdomain gateway feature PR](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/6096#discussion_r385307684)
  - next: address review notes + land remaining DNSLink tests

#### Bitswap Updates
@dirkmc

- [Path to 0.5](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/6782)
- Fixed [bug](https://github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap/pull/272) with determining if any peers have blocks on peer disconnect
- Implemented optimization to [prune peers](https://github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap/commit/4d2bdc274b4862e835d058646d8d828d3631150c) that send to many DONT_HAVE reponses in a row
- js-ipfs-bitswap server side implementation of HAVE / DONT_HAVE messages [close to being merged](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-bitswap/pull/211)


#### Stream Content-Based-Chunking Research/Improvements (go-ipfs / js-ipfs)
@ribasushi
- Continue getting to dagger 0.1. Remaining pieces for this week
  - More tests around stacked chunkers ( corner cases do not work as expected )
  - Implement simpler recursion-less trickle linker ( has implication for stat-keeping)
  - .car output
    - Potentially take .car import/export in go-ipfs

#### Stardust transport/discovery
@vasco-santos

- Will improve browser connectivity for `js-ipfs`. Replacing deprecated `websocket-star`.
- @mkg20001 libp2p-stardust implementation rewritten with async and using the new connection, transport and discovery interfaces
  - [libp2p/js-libp2p-stardust#14](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-stardust/pull/14)
  - Initial review addressed


### Other Initiatives

This is the backlog of initiatives that are either on-hold or low-priority.

#### UnixFS v1.5 (go-ipfs / js-ipfs)
@achingbrain / @ribasushi


#### Add Performance (js-ipfs)
@achingbrain


#### Distributed Signaling (js-libp2p)
@jacobheun

- Spec development will resume in Q2


#### Migration to multihash keys in blockstore (js-ipfs / go-ipfs)
@hsanjuan

### Design Review Proposals
> You want to propose something for design review.

### Blockers/Asks
> You are blocked and need to talk about it to help unblock. List it here!

- The PeerStore updates will result in a cascade of updates needing to happen, will this be finished soon?
  - We're not sure. @Stebalien is going to review this week to see what we can reasonably get implemented before 0.5 and what we need to punt. We may need to bump the protocol version again for the DHT if we need to punt, but this shouldn't be a huge issue.

### Questions
> You have questions and need them answered. List them here.

### Parking Lot
> Anything you would like to discuss that doesn't fit into any of the other categories.

### Week Update (for async review)
> Only post updates that are relevant to the IPFS Core Implementations Work. We know you do a ton more things but for this call, the focus are the implementations ‚ù§Ô∏è üåü
