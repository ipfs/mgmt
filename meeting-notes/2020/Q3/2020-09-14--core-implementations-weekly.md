## Agenda

- Ensure a notetaker exists!
  - The notetaker should:
    - Add bullet points of what is said to each section of this file
    - Wait a day or two for people to add their async updates
    - PR this file into https://github.com/ipfs/team-mgmt
- Ask everyone to put their name into the list of attendees
- Initiatives
- Blockers (from the async status update)
- General questions. Could be things like:
  - I'm stuck with something, I don't know who to ask. Who knows who to ask?
  - Who can help me with xyz?
- Plan for this week
  - Select issues to work on
- Review remaining parking lot topics if there is time left

### High Priority Initiatives

These are the high priority initiatives the team is currently working on.

#### Upcoming/Shipped Releases

- go-ipfs 0.7 RC2 went out last week, https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/releases/tag/v0.7.0-rc2
  - Includes few bugfixes
  - on target for 0.7 this week
  - Only things that needs to go into 0.7 are
    - webui update
    - tiny bugfix
    - some perf intvestigation, to ensure everything works as it should
- go-ipfs 0.7 should release this week https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/7560


#### Pinning Services
@jacobheun / @aschmahmann / @lidel

- WebUI integration work has kicked off
- Some service/client integration issues that need to be resolved

- On the way
- We have a server that responds to things
- We have client that sends requests
- We have initial go-ipfs chunk done, enough to enable http-client to play around with
  - Still need to go and backfill things
     - e.g. handling of pinning service API keys, additional options, convenience shortcuts, etc. 

- On the API spec side
  - @lidel will make new spec version with recent clarifications
  - Changes to the spec:
    - Revamped errors
    - Decreasing limit of CIDs that can be passed to the filter (hard limit to 10)
      - @aschmahmann Can we set limit on characters, in case CID size grows with new encodings / hashing (or just uses longer one)
  - Closer to be happy with spec and docs
  - Target to do major release once go-ipfs ships (server ??)

- https://github.com/rs-ipfs/rust-ipfs/pull/368
- https://github.com/rs-ipfs/rust-ipfs/pull/367
- https://github.com/rs-ipfs/rust-ipfs/pull/366
- https://github.com/rs-ipfs/rust-ipfs/pull/365
- https://github.com/rs-ipfs/rust-ipfs/pull/364

Also, check these out: 
- [Substrate + IPFS tech preview](https://hackmd.io/2pUsb3I4RHGh_TLuKTMVRg)!
- [areweipfsyet.rs](https://areweipfsyet.rs/)
- [autonat PR](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/1672)


Also @gozala, let's talk about the shared worker implementation because OrbitDB 0.26 is coming out soon and 0.27 could potentially utilize it

- @aschmahmann: Q about DHT, is there autonat ?
  - Not yet, leveraging rust-libp2p
  - Request: Maybe it's worth leaving DHTs in client mode, so we don't introduce bad nodes.

#### [js improves discoverability and connectivity](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/issues/703)
@vasco-santos

    - Identify Push + Self Signed Peer Record update on new addr
  - [Working on](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/pull/749) Finding remote relays 
    - Initial approach for a service discovery with namespaces (as go-libp2p-discovery)
    - contentRouting + Rendezvous discovery
    - Decoupling Circuit Transport from Relay service
      - Provide Relay service + Relay lifescycle methods for triggering initial network search
