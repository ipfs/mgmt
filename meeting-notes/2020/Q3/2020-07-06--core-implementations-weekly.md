### Design Review Proposals
> You want to propose something for design reviews

- https://github.com/ipfs/pinning-services-api-spec/
  - need help finalizing this spec, soft ETA is next Monday, and go/js-ipfs are key consumers of this spec
  - let's review async and meet this week (thursday/friday?) 
  - (Add yourself to be on the call)

- [Improving web File Add](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/3029)

  Multiple options were discussed in the [js-ipfs#3029](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/3029) some decisions need to be made on which way to go.

### Blockers/Asks
> You are blocked and need to talk about it to help unblock. List it here!

### Questions
> You have questions and need them answered. List them here.

- Is there really a usecase for depth 2 or 3? I mean, what's the purpose? 
  - To be able to specify replication for a certain portion of the DAG, instead of pinning the root.

### Parking Lot
> Anything you would like to discuss that doesn't fit into any of the other categories.

### Week Update (for async review)
> Only post updates that are relevant 
to the IPFS Core Implementations Work. We know you do a ton more things but for this call, the focus are the implementations ‚ù§Ô∏è üåü
