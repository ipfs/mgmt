## Agenda
- Call for additional agenda items (moderator)
 
- Waffle board review
Is the way that we're using it at an accurate representation of what is happening this week?
     - Sorting by assignee
     - Sorting by Milestone

Q: What about all the little tasks that we have to do that aren't represented on the board?
@haadcode: The board shouldn't be a super micromanager regarding the day to day tasks, but it should be representative of "what are we doing to push things forward this week?"

- I'd like to draw attention to issue #3467 and see what the team thinks of it.
Flagged for 0.4.5 release

- Review of Private Networks notes (@Kubuxu)
