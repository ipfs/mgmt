## Agenda

- Start recording
- Call for additional agenda items (moderator)

- Demos
    -   IPID (DID method spec built on ipfs) (@jonnycrunch)
        -   DID: Decentralized IDentifiers
        -   self-sovereign identities
            -   reference/inspiration: https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/sovrin
        -   use case: DID for physician credentials + verifying claims of treatment, physician proof of license, etc.
        -   Tennessee: no restrictions on physicians for hurricane refugees
        -   decentralized public key infrastructure (PKI)
        -   user can store the treatment they received in verifiable (signed by physician) way
        -   IPID: InterPlanetary IDentifiers -> resolves to IPNS resource (slight extension to IPNS, this approach might change)
        -   pubsub room
            -   can request verifiable claims, verify w/ public key
        -   DDO: DID Descriptor Object
            -   JSON (IPLD probably better) that describes DID + PKI
        -   Next steps
            -   Messaging framework for claims
        -   @diasdavid: how to do trust with self-sovereign IDs?
            -   @jonnycrunch: central authority still required for authentication
            -   also want to be able to resolve claims across different blockchains
        -   Jay Carpenter: this hits on general decentralized naming system goals (e.g. for Filecoin)
        -   Links
