## Agenda

<!-- Ensure notetaker is present before you begin -->
- Start recording
- Call for additional agenda items (moderator)
- benchmark-js.ipfs.io (@diasdavid)
    - Published today, nice new js-ipfs browser stream benchmark visualization
    - @goga-m, the author -- can further improve to keep track of js-ipfs in general
- Moar Benchmarks (@diasdavid)
  - https://github.com/ipfs/benchmark-js.ipfs.io/issues/3
  - @daviddias Proposed further visualization: Big square with tiny blocks appearing as pieces are sent to a node
  - benchmark against http, visualize comparisons in different scenarios (big files vs small files)
  - @goga-m could start with moar basic, useful metrics (puts, adds etc)
  - Victor's suggestion about running multiple tests in the issue above could help with debugging (e.g. browser crash)
  - Other ideas are welcome
- New libp2p transport ready (@diasdavid)
    - clarification on *-star transports
    - websocket-star Now ready https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-websocket-star
        - will be installed by default in next version of js-ipfs
        - very similar to webrtc-star 
        - built as quick fix to reduce memory footprint (webrtc-start is memory intensive)
        - Use it today: https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs#is-there-a-more-stable-alternative-to-webrtc-star-that-offers-a-similar-functionality
    - Next step: rearchitecture module loading in libp2p
- WebUI and Station are getting lots of love (@diasdavid in liaison of @hacdias)
    - @HenriqueDias new contributor
    - webui works again! https://github.com/ipfs/webui
    - station works again! https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/station
        - electron app, drag and drop files to ipfs node
    - stay tuned and contributions welcome

- IPFS-Barcelona Take 2 (@victor)
    - https://www.meetup.com/IPFS-BCN/events/244637091/
    - Planned 16 December
    - Participants welcome (barcelona or remote)

      - connection closing & others addressed
  - js-ipfs https://waffle.io/ipfs/js-ipfs?label=P0%20-%20Critical
      - Many bugs & performance issues solved
      - big 2 up next: 
          - ipld track (dag api, ipld resolver)
          - dht work, need interoperability & debugging
      - @johnnycrunch Q: exposed dag api? ipid is built on ipld but works with ipfs api, would be convenient for others to access dag directly.
      - A: @daviddias haven't seen many requests for direct access to dag nodes, interested to hear of existing use cases
- requesting feedback on https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfsd-ctl/pull/176 - (@dryajov: @js-ipfs)
    - consistent module to start and stop ipfs nodes
    - blocker for required amount of testing on circuit relay
    - @daviddias more context: ipfsd-ctl is the daemon controller: go-ipfs daemons from js-ipfs land.
    - A single place to spawn nodes js or go
    - Make sure to check this PR if you use daemon controller
