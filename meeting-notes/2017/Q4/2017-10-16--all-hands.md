## Agenda

- Start recording
- Call for additional agenda items (moderator)
- Barcelona Hack Day (24th of October [@victorbjelkholm]) https://github.com/ipfs/community/issues/270
    - Talk and hack on IPFS
    - Remote is fine, too
    - Suggestion (@daviddias): use meetup.com using a newly created "IPFS Barcelona" account
- P0's all the things (@diasdavid)
    - Pi is higher prio than P(i+1)
    - freeze P0s during quarter
    - we used issues, milestones, waffleboards
    - currently the strategy is not clear
    - Priority labels in {go,js}-ipfs: P0, P1, P2, ...
    - how to label thousands of issues?
        - add a column for the priority in the waffleboard
        - move it to the respective column
        - once people work on it, it will be moved to InProgress
        - to prevent this, delete the priority columns before moving it to InProgress
    - comments:
        - priority not visible in the waffleboard
- connection closing
    - ipfs network got really big and nodes have too many open file descriptors
    - we have a connection closing branch
    - once that is released, we need to make all the nodes in the wild update
    - question: are we planning to distribute this as a hotfix?
        - hopefully we can get out another release this week, so this might roll out soon!

- Demos
    - PeerPad: P2P hackpad (@diasdavid)
        - read/write access control
            - two keys: one asymmetric key for signing, one symmetric for encrypting
        - snapshots: self contained replica of the given pad to share with others
        - undo: only local changes or other people's writes as well?
            - currently users are not separated
        - how soon can we replace HackMD with PeerPad?
            - Depends mostly on the audit, probably this quarter
