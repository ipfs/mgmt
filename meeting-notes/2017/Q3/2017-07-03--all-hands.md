## Notes

### Rollcall 

See attendees list

### Waffleboard (@diasdavid)

We have been using waffleboards for a while now. For example https://waffle.io/ipfs/js-ipfs. They are supposed to give an overview of who is working on what. 
There are waffleboards for js-ipfs, ipfs, libp2p. You can also help with maintaining and triaging issues! 

- @diasdavid did a cleanup of the js-ipfs board over the weekend
- flow: ready -> in progress -> done or blocked

### Demos
