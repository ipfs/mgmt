## Demos

### IPLD-ETH demo (??m | @kumavis)

@kumavis shows https://kumavis.github.io/metamask-mesh/ which attempts to create a secondary ethereum network which bridges the browser with the main network (tcp/udp). This allows to retrieve information on the latest state of the blockchain directly from the browser, using js-ipfs.

metamask-mesh allows to perform IPLD queries on ethereum blocks and access information such as the balance of an address.  Also works for Tokens!

On the side, a js-ipfs is running with a parity client which acts as a datastore driver for js-ipfs.

LINKS:

* https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-ipfs-browser-client
  * You will find there links to the latest versions of:
  * https://github.com/kumavis/metamask-mesh
    * The client application, uses js-ipfs behind the scenes, connecting through webrtc.
  * https://github.com/kumavis/ipfs-eth-bridge
    * Powered by js-ipfs and parity. You can deploy it yourself using docker-compose.
  * https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-ipfs-browser-client/tree/master/peers
    * These are the peers (IPFS and ETH)

### [InterPlanetary Wayback (ipwb)](https://github.com/oduwsdl/ipwb/) (@machawk1, @ibnesayeed)

ipwb implements an archival replay system (like wayback machine). It is able to index and store, with the help of ipfs, different versions of a website, conventionally stored in WARC files.

WARC files store HTTP headers, payload, and transactions of archival live Web crawls. Usually the HTTP headers are different between accesses (e.g., Date changes) but payloads sometimes stay the same. This opens the potential for de-duplication of redundant content via IPFS. The HTTP header and payload are extracted and stored separately into ipfs. ipfs hashes are stored along with the time, url and saved in an index (a [cdxj](https://github.com/oduwsdl/ORS/wiki/CDXJ) file).

The ipwb replay system just needs to use the index (CDXJ) to reconstruct all the pieces of the original website. It can retrieve the headers and content directly from IPFS. It uses ServiceWorker on replay to prevent URLs of other resources in a page from hitting the live Web. Instead, these resources, too, are pulled from IPFS.
