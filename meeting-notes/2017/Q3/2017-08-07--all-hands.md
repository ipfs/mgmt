## Notes

- go-ipfs plugin system demo
    - go-ipfs can be built with plugins!
    - Kubuxu demos using the git plugin
    - currently only works for linux but osx/win support (from golang itself) is being worked at
    - possible to build a "fatbinary" that embeds plugins
    - current limitation: go-ipfs binary needs to match with the plugin built
- using git-ipld
    - Lukasz M demos how to use git-ipld
    - can now add "ipld::" as a remote and it'll push objects to IPFS!
    - And with returned ipld address, can use for cloning repositories
