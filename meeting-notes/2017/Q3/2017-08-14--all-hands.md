# Notes

# Adding Skein

skein, like blake, is a NIST candidate (finalist)

@kubuxu Nobody is opposed to adding skein. Multihash and multicodec tables are growing quickly. This is making it harder to sync everything up. this came up when we added blake. @kubuxu is not comfortable adding this much bulk to the table at this time -- needs confirmation from others who work on the tables, but hasn't been able to get ahold of them.

@donaldtsang there are ways to trim it, just like with blake

@kubuxu want to move to generated tables. the more codecs we add there, the harder it will be to migrate


# Fixing the moderator/notetaker rotation
We have generator, but the list it drifted out of date.
Is just ok to update the readme?
Idea: invitations that can be confirmed and moderators can be selected form there.
Idea: just shuffle the list of people that joined the call

# Installing go-ipfs on Windows
Important to match expectation of Windows user about installer.
Brad will search for existing issue and/or create it.

# Discuss IPFS meeting time
