## What Worked
- Having a repo, waffle board, assignees, etc.
- Getting more emails & engagement since improving the docs -- so seems it worked
- Standups every other day 
- Improved the docs & examples for a bunch of stuff - libp2p, js-ipfs
- Working _just_ on documentation day after day was painful. Needs to turn into a continuous effort. Docs need to be kept up to date
- Especially hard to write docs for code that's new to you, particularly if the existing examples are broken.
- Having a handful of people dedicated to the topic motivated work, made sure PRs would get merged quickly, etc
- @sidharder and @JayCarpenter jumping in and helping with organizing and ideas helped

## What Didn't Work
- People dropping from sprint at the beginning of the sprint
- Didn't have a clear vision of what the final deliverable was (wasn't clear what the finished state wouldshould look like)
- Task of making sure we're on the right path didn't really budge
- (Did not-having-a-PM work or not work?)
- Needed another 2-4 weeks to really make progress
- starting zoom sessions took an annoying amount of itme a couple times

## Misc Notes

- Keeping docs up to date should be continuous and should involve everyone
- We got by OK without someone specifically responsible for the project management tasks (grooming waffle board, schedulign meetings, etc) but that could have fallen off the wheels if we kept doing it on a standing basis. maybe in the future teams will be able to choose whether they need a PM
