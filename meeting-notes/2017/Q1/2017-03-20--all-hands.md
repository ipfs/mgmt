- Doing away with the roll call (@flyingzumwalt)
    - Observation, since we do the roll call, we've received fewer new people joining the calls
    - Roll call is repetitive and always takes a couple of minutes
    - You can set a display name in Zoom, right-click on yourself
    - Decision: let's do away with it. Optionally new people can still introduce themselves.
- Finalizing the Discourse (community forum software) Decision (@flyingzumwalt)
    - Background: [Creating a Community Forum for IPFS and Related Projects](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/decisions/community-forum-platform.md)
