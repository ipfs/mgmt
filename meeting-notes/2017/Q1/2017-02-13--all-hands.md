## Notes

- The go specific contribution guideline should be more general than go-ipfs guideline; we need to refactor this.
- TODO @Richard open an issue about making a Contribute.md in each repository
- github [ added a default contributor license](https://github.com/blog/2314-new-github-terms-of-service)
- might obviate the need for gitcop (because gitcop is annoying)
- Do we have a section in the readme about how to run our tests?
    - maybe put this in the contribute.md
- demo time!
- victor demos jenkins server, looks rather pretty. Uses github auth, runs tests.
- still not working 100%, needs a bit more configuration
