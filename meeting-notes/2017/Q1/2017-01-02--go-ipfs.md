## Agenda
<!-- Ensure notetaker is present before you begin -->
- Call for additional agenda items (moderator)
- Retrospective
    - With respect to the little time we have available and to enable everyone to have time to present their feedback, try to frame your point with:
      - What was good
      - What was confusing, less productive
      - What do you want to continue or to see started
- questions:
    - Sprints pace (how is the 1 week thing doing for everyone?)
    - Waffle: Is waffle useful for you? Did it enable you to contribute more? Tells us how you use it or how you would like to be using it
    - Are the roadmap documents helpful?
    - How about support for all the users, did you feel you got your questions answered? What were the pain points when trying to figure out something?
    - How does everyone feel with what we've achieved so far?
    - Anything else you feel you should bring to the table :)

    - pain points
        - slow feedback cycle
        - adds stress to individuals, many concurrent in-progress things
        - lots of context switching
        - need to get better at following through
        - excourse on PM and sprints in the industry
        - idea: in addition to weekly sprints, have monthly project sprints
        - also: we wanna move go-ipfs to a bi-weekly release schedule
            - one week of dev, one week of review
    - achievements
        - we achieved a lot, but everything is just *almost* done
        - we shipped none of it because 0.4.5 hasn't been released yet
