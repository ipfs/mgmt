## Agenda

<!-- Ensure notetaker is present before you begin -->
- Start recording
- Call for additional agenda items (moderator)
- [ipfs-search](http://ipfs-search.com/) is dead, long live ipfs-search! (@dokterbob)
    - had sponsored hosting for a while, but had to shut down the site today (cost has been $200/mo)
    - would love some contributions and support
    - the last search index is on ipfs: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXA1Wiy3Ko29Q54Sq7pkyu8yTa7JmPokvgx4CXtQBWirt
        - indexing all content it finds, ~200GB
    - index is elasticsearch 5 snapshot format
    - also uses rabbitmq and tika and java-ipfs
    - @jaycarpenter: offering help
    - @lgierth: would be interesting to see if we can convert the index to the IPLD format that wikipedia-on-ipfs.org uses for search
    - @jaycarpenter: might also be useful for the telescope indexing idea
    - Talk on #ipfssearch on Freenode (or #ipfs-search:chat.weho.st on Matrix)
- IIIF meeting & demo (@lgierth for @flyingzumwalt)
    - iiif is suite of specs for displaying and interacting with highres images, used by many libraries and other institutions
    - conference hosted by vatican last week
    - demo by drew from stanford library and @edsilv from holocene (main devs on iiif viewer)
        - viewer loading images and 3d content from ipfs
        - interactive annotations over ipfs, using pubsub
        - well received, and exciting possibilities for ipfs in the libraries/archives/museums/galleries space
    - idea: ipfs node serving iiif api (TODO @flyingzumwalt to post github issue)
- next go-ipfs release (@lgierth for @whyrusleeping)
    - cutting rc1 today
    - wanna get a few more random test failures fixed
    - exciting new feature: `ipfs ptp` command for external programs mounting their connections onto ipfs
    - also: able to specify hashing algorithm when adding
    - @lgierth to get changelog and blog post ready
    - publish blog post for release candidate so it draws more attention for testing
    - @dokterbob: what's the process for experimental features?
        - no fixed process so far
        - want high certainty and low risk
        - want documentation, and performance characteristics
        - e.g. filestore is high risk
        - also want feedback from users
    - experimental features need to be more obvious and draw more attention
        - github issues vs. discourse
        - maybe also in each release changelog. so we constantly draw attention to these experimental features
- IoT Fest (@jaycarpenter)
    - Chris Matthieu did an awesome IPFS and IoT presentation at the Intel IoT Dev Fest on June 3. It was very well received.
