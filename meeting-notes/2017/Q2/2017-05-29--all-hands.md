## Agenda

<!-- Ensure notetaker is present before you begin -->
- Start recording
- Roll call, by [timezone from east to west](../admin-guides/timezone-rollcall.md).
- Call for additional agenda items (moderator)

<!-- Add items above this line. Use this format:
  - Item (@your_name: @target_audience)
-->

- Library of Congress dataset (@lgierth)
    - 10 days ago, metadata set published
    - added to IPFS, files larger than original (somehow de-compressed on download?)
    - dataset good representation of one with questions about how to store large, hoarded datasets on distributed network/how people want to access that
    - mapping IPLD onto dataset -- where does it fit, where does it overkill? balancing between classic (outdated?) format and newer IPLD, zipped vs raw
    - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14436291
    - https://github.com/ipfs/archives/issues/152
- static.network (@lgierth)
    - twitter-esque clone using IPFS
    - non-permanent pubsub
    - https://github.com/ipfs/research-CRDT for further IPFS + crdt interest
- Discourse update (@flyingzumwalt)
  - decommisioning ipfs/faq and ipfs/support
  - teaser of stuff on discourse https://discuss.ipfs.io/t/video-music-streaming/528/2
  - lower volume of request support on discourse than github/ipfs/faq
      - @diasdavid -- people might be trying to find their way around on github and solve issue there
      - way to clearly specify what should go where (questions, documentation, etc)
  - doesn't seem to be a way to stop editing/adding of github issues while also maintaining read access
  - Matt misses vine :(
- Demos
    - Proof of concept: Namecoin on IPFS (@llopv)
        - https://github.com/ipfs/notes/issues/41#issuecomment-304115810
        - want to make namecoin blockchain accessible via gateway, rather than pulling entire BC down
        - @llopv -- entire BC often needed to verify lookups/integrity
        - @lgierth -- different blockchains to verify each other (e.g. Bitcoin timestamps Namecoin) -> separate querying of BC and having data in IPFS
        - @flyingzumwalt -- should be able to do some sort of query validation over IPFS
        - @llopv -- chain changes ~10 minutes when block is added
        - @flyingzumwalt -- thinks BCs will end up on IPFS anyway, which gives leverage/helps solve these problems

- @flyingzumwalt: need transparent/repeatable community process for publishing wikipedia snapshots
    - ref: https://github.com/ipfs/distributed-wikipedia-mirror/issues/8
    - changes only made by small IPFS additions (e.g. 'this is a snapshot', IPFS logo)
    - make this repeatable for community/future wikipedia adds
    - want to have confidence in integrity of datasets (e.g. government datasets)
    - common pattern in various datasets, document general model
    - maintainers (w/ write-access) use kubernetes-ipfs to update snapshot

<!-- After each call, it is the responsibility of the notetaker to save the last
version of the notes in a file in ipfs/pm/meeting-notes, by opening a branch and
submitting a PR. -->
