# Agenda

* call for additonal agenda items
* Review Q1 OKRs in [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oFoWvu8ZSBaJqOjKLDwsoGjsKZTXbI2W33j8IjJBJH8/edit#gid=0)
* Jonnycrunch: I'm going to be meeting with Robert Kahn in a few weeks to discuss DONA for DOI and will be proposing IPFS.  Also meeting with NIST regarding Identity management. It would be great to submit IPFS protocols, multiformats and hash table to IANA. 

# Demos

* @flyingzumwalt has a hunch there's gonna be lots of demos next week

# Notes

- lab week
    - once a quarter protocol labs convenes at a place to plan the next quarter
    - that's why many of us are currently at the same place
- role call
    - no more roll call as it's repetitive
    - still please introduce yourself if you're new :)
- Q1 review
    - sprint model was an experiment
    - we didn't really set goals for each Q1 sprint, but goals emerged while preparing and working on the sprint
    - we hope that in the future other orgs will set ipfs-related goals too, and try to achieve them
    - data.gov
        - didn't get all of data.gov loaded into ipfs
        - stanford collaborators got it download at least though
            - made billions of directories, hit go-ipfs bug, we'll fix it
        - we did create tools for working with datasets: ipfs-pack
        - 100 TB: didn't work on that kind of scale, turned out to not be relevant to the sprint
            - current biggest dataset: 4 TB (tested add, tested transfer)
    - in-web-browsers
        - positive score for the month (two sprints)
        - third sprint, one week
            - dht implementation
            - super productive review and refinements of circuit relay spec
    - solidify ipld
        - shipped basic DAG API: resolve, get, put
        - ethereum community using ipld already
        - all of the DAG API tested, documented, implemented in Go+JS
        - remaining things are in discovery phase
            - patch API, transformations, 
        - want more formats
            - cbor, more blockchains, git
    - ethereum collab
        - initiated by kumavis (of metamask)
        - goal: get parity to use libp2p/ipld
        - shipped early Q1
    - CI / CD / Infra-automation
        - goal: improve CI and testing
        - goal: integration tests between go-ipfs/go-ipfs-api/js-ipfs/js-ipfs-api
        - goal: replace Travis CI and Circle CI
        - shipped Jenkins at https://ci.ipfs.team
        - shipped basic testing of go-ipfs
        - remaining stages: move more and more testing into Jenkins, 
    - orbit
        - moved to github.com/orbitdb
        - shipped release process
            - remaining: integrate with dist.ipfs.io
        - works nicely with <10 users
        - recent versions on https://orbit.chat
    - project websites
        - libp2p.io, multiformats.io, ipld.io
        - preliminary libp2p website up at https://libp2p.io
        - early multiformats website up at https://multiformats.io 
        - ipld website is being worked on
        - repos: github.com/$org/website
    - in-web-browsers
        - could have used more time, since we were making actual progress :)
        - probably want to work more on it in Q2
    - private networks
        - shipped with go-ipfs 0.4.7 :)
        - spec in libp2p/specs PR
        - howto in "experimental features" issue: https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/3397
    - ipfs-cluster
        - sprint 1: features
            - also addresses a bunch of feedback by @jbenet
        - sprint 2: stability
            - has gotten more stable, want more testing around various topologies, dynamic topologies, failure scenarios, etc.
        - could have more adoption and testing
    - test-lab
        - was underspecified at the beginning
        - but shipped a few things (thanks @FrankPetrilli)
        - shipped test-lab orchestrator, people can now add machines. has guide and video.
            - needs user testing :)
        - the first pieces are there!
        - have a few go-ipfs tests, and a few ipfs-cluster tests
    - documentation
        - didn't have PM, @SidHarder and @JayCarpenter helped out
        - need someone who's responsible for documentation vision
        - people just jumped on docs fires and high-value tasks
        - docs/websites tooling is being worked on
        - got noticeable bump in new activity, from js-ipfs docs improvements
        - decided on discourse community forums (discuss.ipfs.io coming soon)
- DONA / DOI
    - following up with Rob Kahn about multiformats and IPFS
    - anything submitted to IANA would be helpful (because it's authoritative)
        - yes, ipfs:// and dweb: schemes
    - use case: IPFS of DONA?
