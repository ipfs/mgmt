Notes:
- Matts hair is very windblown
- Some projects have a good process of defining how issues should be triaged and labeled. Having a clear process makes it possible for people to contribute by doing this label filtering
    - Triaging issues creates better entry points for new contributors
    - Triage itself could be a contribution, although permissions for labels, etc. might be limiting
    - How do we triage today?
        - @whyrusleeping triages most go-ipfs issues
            - Actionable vs. non-actionable
            - Bug, Enhancement, Panic
            - Aim to make something actionable or close quickly
	- Jay Carpenter interested, will need to work with core team member. Will follow issue [ipfs/pm/#449] for news.
	- - Requests for help:
- @lgierth to add notes about labels/security tooling
- 'latest' on the ipfs website needs updating
    - Need help sourcing news articles for the ipfs website
- English and kurdish wikipedias are up on ipfs, havent been announced
    - Working on a process to make this all community managed
    - need to be careful about provenance of data
    - Definitely need help, if anyone is interested get in touch
- Want to have a blogpost for each new ipfs release
    - maybe have a separate 'tech blog' for ipfs?
    - maybe the titles of blog posts can separate from an 'announcement' and an actual blog post
    - definitely need more blog posts
