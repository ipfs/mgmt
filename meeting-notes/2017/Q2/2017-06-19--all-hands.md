## Agenda

- Start recording
    - unsure who was host, this didn't happen
- Call for additional agenda items (moderator)
- ipfs ptp command naming (@lgierth)
    - name maybe confusing/unclear, maybe better as `ipfs p2p`
    - @Kubuxu: confusing with other p2p usage (e.g. libp2p)
    - would be cool to break off this functionality from ipfs and use libp2p only
- go-ipfs v0.4.10
    - changelog pushed, release candidate planned for today (want to decide on `ipfs ptp` command name first), release later this week
    - many fun updates, try them out :)

- @lgierth to figure out how to record

- Demos
    - None
