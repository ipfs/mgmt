## Notes

@fsdiogo hoping to create a PR this week for Exchange Files. Upload files to a work space and would be able see files uploaded there. Focusing on UI.

@achingbrain focusing on getting the MFS updates working first and then will look at getting the interop w/ go behavior working correctly.

@diasdavid - there are a lot of things going on around the jsipfs 0.29 release that need to get resolved.

@zcstarr - Needs a review from @vmx but can continue work, not blocked.

@hugomrdias - Hard to debug browser tests (js-ipfs). Lack of source maps leads to no stack trace, making it difficult to determine where issues are coming from.

@mkg20001 - @daviddias to look at the 2 PRs that are blocking.

### Questions

- (VictorBjelkholm) will activate code coverage via codecov rather than coveralls, any objections?
  - Badges will need to be updated
  - Still want to keep %coverage change in PRs
  - No issues switching to codecov
- (mkg) libp2p-nodetrust: will this ever get deployed?
  - need more time to determine yes or no
  - has been getting pushed due to other priorities
  - missing reviews from core libp2p contributors
- (mkg) utp: extend utp protocol to add half open connection closing?
  - could add a connection upgrade to handle this

### Other notes

- Crashing daemon! https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/1325
	- Let's fix this so we can deploy js-ipfs on js.ipfs.io!
