## Notes

- sprint planning calls
    - sprints ending on friday, demos on monday
    - new sprints on monday
    - big one "ipfs in the browser"
- sprint retrospective calls
    - if worked on sprint or sprintino, on friday at 5PM UTC we have sprint retrospective
    - different format than last time, @MattZumwalt will post a proposal asap
    - should it be open or not?
        - possible solution: not open but record, but would be public for everyone
        - possible solution: generally closed, but if really interested, ask to participate
- ipfs in the browser
    - sprint focused on aligning everything to be easy to use in browsers
    - create new repository for tracking the work. Name will be something like: "browser-integration" or similar
