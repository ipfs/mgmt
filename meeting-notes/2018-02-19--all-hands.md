- Good time to discuss all hands call evolution? (@Admin-DataRoads, 1 min)
    - https://github.com/ipfs/pm/issues/548
    - Proposal: solve 2 problems at the same time.  New call to make newcomers more welcome plus take away some of the time burden on this call so that we can fit it within 30 minutes.
    - TODO: Jared will open an issue discussing this further
    - Q @RobBrackett: have we before tried having 2-3 hour Office hour times?
    - A @daviddias: we have.  We stopped because we got derailed by life and it was hard to maintain consistency.  Open to trying again.
    - @flyingzumwalt: need to time bound 2 hours a week is a lot of time
    - @kubuxu: 1 on 1 time is very useful for the person getting help, but we could be using this time to create documentation for everyone
    - @flyingzumwalt: would be useful to have a little structure, ex: a topic of discussion
