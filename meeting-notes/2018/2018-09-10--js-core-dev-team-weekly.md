    - Many fixes to API docs [#1538](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/1538)
    - Made progress adding `--cid-base` option to _all_ relevant `js-ipfs` commands (working in branch [feat/cid-base-option](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/tree/feat/cid-base-option))

    - Jenkins npm errors frequent [#51](https://github.com/ipfs/testing/issues/51)
    - Jenkins windows workers out of space [#135](https://github.com/ipfs/testing/issues/135)
- Next:
    - Release js-ipfs 0.32
    - Finish `--cid-base` option
    - Create interop tests for block store get by CIDv0/1
    - Implement block store get by CIDv0/1

@achingbrain
- Done:
  - Spun up npm registry at https://registry.js.ipfs.io
    - Play along at home with `npm i --registry=https://registry.js.ipfs.io`
  - Fixed flaky pubsub tests https://github.com/ipfs/interop/pull/33
  - Made pin tests less flaky https://github.com/ipfs/interop/pull/34
  - Consolidated HTTP API https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/js-ipfs-http
- Blocked:
  - Create S3 backend for npm-on-ipfs: https://github.com/ipfs/infrastructure/issues/432
  - Remove password requirement from libp2p-keychain? https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-keychain/pull/25

- Next:

@jacobheun
 - Done:
   - Added core state machine logic for libp2p-switch. Started working on the connection state machine logic. Reviewed several existing issues surrounding the [state machine issue for libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/issues/98) to make sure that is incorporated.
   - Have a basic demo of delegated routing working against a local instance of the supporting go-ipfs branch. Will demo today at IPFS All Hands.
     - I believe there is a performance issue here when the numbner of providers is low. The http query stays open until at least 20 providers are found. I've seen this stay open for 30+ minutes.
   - Patch release for libp2p-switch (0.40.8) for dependency updates, including multistream-select already piped fix version bump.   
 - Blocked:
   - Delegated routing support in [go-ipfs#4594](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/4595).
