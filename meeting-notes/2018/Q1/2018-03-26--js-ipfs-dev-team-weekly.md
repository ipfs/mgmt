### General Questions

 - How do I put items I'm currently working on into the done/blocked/next scheme?
   - The scheme is for the current point in time. So those things will be in "done" and "next" at the same time
 - How to verify that PRs work if they have other dependencies?
    - Add the information about the dependencies into the PR and the reviewers will test it locally

 
### Other notes

 - @diasdavid proposes having a daemon pool for the tests, so tests run faster
 - Please use the Waffle Board as intended. See the first meeting notes for more information on that
   - Introducing a new label for being blocked: https://github.com/ipfs/wg-qa-testing-dx/issues/34
   - "In progress" means you are actively working on an issue and are not blocked
  - OKRs: @diasdavid will open an PR which will be used to discuss them: https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/1281
