- <IPLD questions> <@pcardune>
    - Intro Paul Carduner-- Nori project: decentralized marketplace for carbon removal credits 
    -Q @pcardune: IPLD vs CBOR?
    -A @daviddias: 
    - IPLD is the canonical way to represent hash linked data
        - git
        - ipfs
        - bitcoin
        - any hash, any format
    - IPFS's DAG-API manipulates IPLD objects
        - get: get IPLD object with cid
            - can also get properties of object
            - some properties are LINKS 
            - makes resolving simple
        - put: add IPLD objects to IPFS data store

    - Q @pcardune: default hash
    - A: sha256
    - Q @pcardune: CBOR vs IPLD
    - A:
        - CBOR was firt format "merkledag"
            - data field
            - links filed
        - currently in use, ex during ipfs add
        - now we have DAG CBOR
            - doesn't require a schema
            - not forced to use data and links
            - define your own format
    - Q @zenground0: DAG-CboR vs IPLD
    - A:
        - DAG CBOR is a specific IPLD format
        - modules for different format in ipld github org
        - Make some decisions on how to use CBOR to represent JSON
        - "We don't mess with your data"

    - Q @Mr0grog: If your impl hasn't registered IPLD format is it the case that your node can't resolve data encoded in these formats?
    - A: Yes, but you can get the data and from CIDs you can potentially register 
        - exploring creating resolvers in language (rust) compiling to WASM
        - WASM fetched from network, node can update ipld resolver to handle format on the fly using code
        - Don't quote David but this can be made to be "safe"
        - js-ipld repo is a good resource
        - js-ipfs has examples in "examples" folder
    - @flyingzumwalt -- you can still fetch the content if you don't have the data's format resolver, but if you want to use ipld selectors (i.e. to deserialize into ipld and follow links) THEN you will need the resolver.
    - @Jay Carpenter -- Where can people study this on their own
    - @flyingzumwalt -- Documentation is still being created.  Tutorials pending.  They will focus on simple ideas before diving too deep
