    - Automated Website Builds (@VictorBjelkholm)

        - Set up with most Protocol Labs websites aside from ipfs.io, protocol.ai, filecoin.io
    - Prerecorded demos for work-in-progress work in IPFS Companion by @alanshaw (@lidel, 3min)
        - [PoC of window.ipfs on google^Wevery page](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1ldUp_mjDk) (1 min video)
        - [PoC of window.ipfs access controls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXLERp9-Mis) (3 min video)
            - Access controls handle permissions for API calls (adding content, etc.)
            - Only working on Chrome right now, not Firefox (need new (UI) approach for latter due to Mozilla strictness)
            - Permissions will be opt-in for now
            - @diasdavid: Can we whitelist other extensions?
                - @lidel: Yes, separate API can allocate ports for other extensions. This will be developed more in the future, lower priority than UI/webpage permissions
        - [Technical walkthrough on how window.ipfs works in IPFS Companion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTOUMWujoEg) (17 min vid)
        - Thoughts? Feedback? `window.ipfs` is tracked in [ipfs-companion/issues/#330](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/issues/330), [#362](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/issues/362)
