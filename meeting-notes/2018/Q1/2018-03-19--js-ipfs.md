## Agenda

- Ask everyone to put their name into the list of attendees
- Round of updates
  - What have you accomplished since the last Weekly?
  - Were there any blockers? If so, which ones? Is it still blocked? Why?
  - What is the next important thing you should focus on?
- Ask for general questions. Could be things like:
  - I'm stuck with something, I don't know who to ask. Who knows who to ask?
  - Who can help me with xyz?
- Plan this week
  - Select issues to work on
- Review remaining issues if there is time left


## Notes

- Lots of new members! Introductions all around
- @diasdavid gave an overview of project management and selecting issues
	- For more info, check out the top section of the meeting notes here:
  https://cryptpad.fr/code/#/1/edit/FimZ1XlMSetYoFpW4UvIiA/7JYjZyP3EQQwGPjV1Bo+cgLg/
- @mkg
	- please send recommendations for good tutorials for a socket.io server
  - Hopes to finish and demo libp2p-dissector
- @victorbjelkholm
	- concerned about current state of websocket-star as it crashes when we have a lot of peers
  - js-ipfs deployment is stuck because daemon is not stable enough
  	- @disdavid: Can we get a bunch of stress tests?
    - victor: daemon fails randomly, can we add a try/catch where we start a node and handle errors there? If you connect to websocket-start, the daemon will crash at one point or another
    - david: it is inevitable that errors happen. A stress test would be useful. We should fix the specific bugs we know about
    - victor: It's important to have an error handler for errors in general, not just specific issues. We need to have a global handler that doesn't crash the process
    - david: Could use process.uncaughtException but it's actually cheaper to reboot the process than to try to unwind some weird state. We need a way to handle uncaught exceptions and we also need to fix specific exceptions.
- @jonkrone
	- asked: What's the best way to move forward with a large PR for a new feature?
  	- @disdavid: comprehensive tests. go-ipfs' suite for pinning is comprehensive, cross-reference it to improve confidence in the feature
- @Mr0Grog raised thoughts re: https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/1263
  - Other than just inline comments, how can we provide more complete options information for `new IPFS({})`?
