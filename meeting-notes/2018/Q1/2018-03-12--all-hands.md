## Agenda

- Adjusting Schedule for Daylight Savings (flyingzumwalt, 4min)
    - ... and updating the IPFS calendar!
    - Q: Do we want to update the call time for DST or leave it where it is? Specifically, change to 16:00 UTC.
    - A: Change nothing. Ignore DST.
    - Errata: Fix calender timezone to not be New York (otherwise, we'll follow EST and obey DST).
    - https://github.com/ipfs/pm/issues/433
- [Setting Q2 OKRs](https://github.com/ipfs/pm/issues/582) (@flyingzumwalt, 5min)
    - End of Q1 is Mar 26
    - Set Q2 OKRs on/before Apr 1
    - WG leaders talk with @flyingzumwalt to set OKRs.
    - WG members talk with WG leaders if you want to be involved.
    - (see issue for more information)
- RFC Process and Governance RFC (@flyingzumwalt, 10min)
    - [RFC #1](https://github.com/ipfs/rfcs/pull/1) Bootstrapping the RFC process
        - Almost ready to merge. Comment *now* if you have anything to say.
    - [RFC #2](https://github.com/ipfs/rfcs/pull/2) IPFS Governance 
        - Main point: Need at least 3 people in a WG to set OKRs. Otherwise, you'll need to merge.
        - Take a look at distinction between team/WG and comment.
