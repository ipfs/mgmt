# Agenda
General discussions, decisions, etc.
- What is the Zoom meeting ID?  The old ID doesn’t seem to work. (Jay)
  - https://protocol.zoom.us/j/443621844, we’ve done some updates to meetings across the board to improve our hosting support of meetings. The Community Calendar should have the latest links.
- Check in about OKRs (flyingzumwalt)
  - When will OKRs be presented to the broader community?
  - This Wednesday, the OKR meeting will be open to the community, so anyone can attend and see what is being planned for the next quarter. https://github.com/ipfs/pm/issues/705
  - OKRs can also be reviewed in their respective sheets. OKRs can be edited after this week but will be locked on October 4th.
  - Grade your last quarter’s OKRs if you haven’t already done so. This is particularly for the go-ipfs team. Q3 OKRs can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19vjigg4locq4fO6JXyobS2yTx-k-fSzlFM5ngZDPDbQ/edit#gid=1720716278
