## Agenda

## Quick Announcements

- 	(Molly, 30sec) Our Youtube Livestreaming is fixed!!! Sorry for the folks who didn‚Äôt get to livestream these calls in the moment - but you‚Äôll find all the recordings on our Youtube channel.
	If anyone runs into the issue it‚Äôs not showing up, check the FAQ where you‚Äôll see the debug

-	(David, 2min) It is that time of the Quarter, Mid-Q Scoring https://github.com/ipfs/team-mgmt/issues/755

## Main Presentation

-	@Gozala (10-15min talk+Q&A) - mozilla/libdweb 
	- Project home:  https://github.com/mozilla/libdweb/
	- Protocol API - Allows implementing something like IPFS natively in the browser
	- DNS Service Discovery - Node discovery
	- TCP Socket - listen, connect, exchange messages
	- UDP Socket - broadcast messages & exchange data
	- Mount directory as a filesystem and have read/write access
	- Can build an experimental addon and try it out
	- Process contains many steps - currently designing a threat model
	- APIs were written before readable/writeable streams  - planning to update to use those
	- Protocol API doesn‚Äôt yet have support for headers
	- Call for contributors! Open an issue on github and suggest how to solve it

	- üëè@lidel & @alanshaw for integrating this into companion (in libdweb branch): https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/blob/libdweb/docs/libdweb.md 
	- Ipfs demos built with those APIs:
protocol handler PoC
	- Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS8pLOQdOoM
	- PR: (wip) https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/pull/533  
	- local discovery and TCP transport PoC 
	- Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRzyWUXIyeo 
	- PR (wip): https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/pull/553 
	- Are there non-code ways to contribute?
	- Ideas on threat model would be useful! Ideas for how things can be abused
	- Requires critical thinking about how things exposed could be abused
	- Mozilla test infra is highly coupled with firefox build structure, so currently could use additional test coverage
	- IRC channel: #dweb @ irc.mozilla.org
	- Would this require changes for mozilla for how it handles extensions?
	- Shouldn‚Äôt require any extra steps other than writing an addon and shipping it
	- ‚ÄúProtocol handler‚Äù is the most sensitive piece for the threat model (impersonation)
	- What about other transports (QUIC, webRTC, etc)? Still having to also use a stream muxer to hide keys
	- Now that have a normal socket, could directly mount QUIC‚Ä¶
	- Trying to form a W3C interest group
	- A lot of the code comes from flyweb - is there a new wave of interest?
	- Historical accident - gotten some advice from the team who developed it
	- Idea: what if websites could host their own servers on desktop (ex mobile connecting to desktop) - uses similar local connection to IPFS (DNS local service discovery)
	- Thoughts on getting wider browser adoption - there are things to add to browser that unlocks more capabilities you currently *have*to go to cloud for
