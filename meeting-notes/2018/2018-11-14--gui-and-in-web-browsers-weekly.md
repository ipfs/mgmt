### Discussion Highlights

- We will be experimenting with [Signed HTTP Exchanges and WebPackage](https://github.com/ipfs/in-web-browsers/issues/121) on our public gateway by [participating in Chrome's Origin Trial](https://github.com/ipfs/infrastructure/issues/453)
    - SXG will land in 2019 because Google wants solve AMP misattribution problem ASAP. We are looking into it from DWeb perspective, as IPFS is perfect distribution platform for immutable data and provides viable alternative to centralized CDNs. 
      - This effort got briefly mentioned during Chrome Dev Summit 2018 as "folks working on decentralized web at Protocol Labs" ([~24:35](https://github.com/ipfs/in-web-browsers/issues/121#issuecomment-438649387))
- Working towards Share App to work for users without ipfs-companion installed - [ipfs-share-files/issues/43](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-share-files/issues/43)
    - How to safely enable js-ipfs fallback and remove load from public gateways?
    - Key issue are file size limits (we need to research what is the storage cap in browsers and solve UX around it)
- ipfs-desktop 1.0 revamp is will land in master this week - final touches: [ipfs-desktop/pull/662](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop/pull/662)
- Herding cats around API changes across the stack
    - Alan did a lot of PR reviews to ensure we don't have regresions in GUI/Browser, especially around CIDs
- https://proto.school revamp coming soon. 
    - Teri and Mikeal want to land it by the end of December
    - We should coordinate points of overlap (API changes, best practices etc)
- New Web UI [v2.2](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-webui/releases/tag/v2.2.0) is mobile-friendly, supports manual language selector and solves Peer screen issue due to QUIC multiaddrs
- First draft of Roadmaps for 2019 landed (see link in Action Items)
- FUN FACT FROM ALAN:
    - not all multibase encodings are safe for use in paths and URIs! :-)
        - e.g. `mAXASIIpT3/gOX/CEwjyboSt5TcaYTaVeqplvOkZ8vEB9N6AK`
        - OH NOES `/ipfs/mAXASIIpT3/gOX/CEwjyboSt5TcaYTaVeqplvOkZ8vEB9N6AK`
    - CIDs encoded in multibase with "/" character (eg base64) break path-addressing 
    - Good example/illustration why [base32 is the "safe default"](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs/issues/337)
- Should we consolidate GUIs and App Maintenance under a single ipfs-apps team? (see action item)
