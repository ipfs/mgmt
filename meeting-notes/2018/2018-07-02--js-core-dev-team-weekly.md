  - (Almost) finished updating `js-ipfs` with `js-libp2p` config changes [#1401](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/1401)
  - Merged and released `interface-ipfs-core` modular tests [#290](https://github.com/ipfs/interface-ipfs-core/pull/290) found many issues in CI stopping sister PRs [#1389](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/1389) and [#785](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-api/pull/785) from being merged. Much investigation, PR open here for fix [#319](https://github.com/ipfs/interface-ipfs-core/pull/319)

@jacobheun
  - Done: 
    - Finished up the libp2p new config updates with all examples updated, [#166](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/pull/166).
    - Added latest webrtc to libp2p which fixes node issues. Also improved test stability. [#211](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/pull/211)
    	- It would be ideal to have some load tests against the wrtc module as people had issues with it in the past seg faulting
    - Private networking PRs ready to be reviewed:
      - [libp2p #210](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/pull/210)
      - [libp2p-switch #266](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-switch/pull/266)
      - [libp2p-pnet #1](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-pnet/pull/1)
    - Q2 retrospective and Q3 OKR prep for libp2p
  - Blocked: 
    - Reviews of https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-pnet/pull/1 to finish private networking.
  - Next:
    - Work on finalizing Q3 OKRs for libp2p
    - Get private networking merged through to libp2p and add PRs for js-ipfs and js-ipfs-repo.
    - Look into flaky tests mention in [js-ipfs #1401](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/1401#issuecomment-401542964)
    	- This is likely due to multiple test runners on the shared system having the same ID. Could be hard to reproduce, ideal to get stronger test isolation there.
    - Continue looking into pull-reader issues with overreading resulting in skip tests in private networking for interop mentioned in [interop #24](https://github.com/ipfs/interop/pull/24)
    - Prepping [libp2p connection flow presentation](https://github.com/libp2p/developer-meetings/issues/12) for next weeks Berlin meetup.
