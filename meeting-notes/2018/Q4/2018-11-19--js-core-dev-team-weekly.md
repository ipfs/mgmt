### Questions

### Other notes

- Please try to keep in mind this call is designed to be quick updates. As the team is growing, we'll run out of time if we're not careful with our time. Blocked items are reviewed by @diasdavid and others asynchronously after the call, so if you have issues, listing them there should be adequate.

- Jacob out Thursday and Friday

<!-- After each call, the notetaker submits a PR to ipfs/pm to store the notes on the meeting-notes folder -->
