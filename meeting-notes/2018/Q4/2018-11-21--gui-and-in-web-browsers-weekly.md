- IPFS Share App: wip on improvements for users without ipfs-companion (embedded js-ipfs + gateway)
- Proto School: wip on saving state to local storage between learning sessions
- Open discussion: working hours / open-door-policy to provide support for people with questions about GUI/websites? 
- PSA: Working Group Capacity Planner (@all: see Action Item below)
- We did Milestone Evaluation Exercise ([notes](https://hackmd.io/haC8c6tPQYiBHJp09KzbMQ))
  - Review of [IPFS Project KPI Draft](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r2Ng8Ura9yg63Aq8sXpJQ-PKFhDzJADoHRxZUESUugg/edit#) (will be made public in following weeks)
  - Everyone grabbed one Milestone and picked one Awesome and one Meh milestone and we discussed what makes them that way.
    - Brief discussion about the need for explaining basic concepts "just in time", so users are not overwhelmed. Both [docs.ipfs.io](https://docs.ipfs.io/guides/concepts/) and [proto.school](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/proto.school/pull/59) try to address this. 
    - Creating websites with IPFS is a good opportunity to onboard users  with IPFS concepts.
