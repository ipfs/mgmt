  - Done:
    - Review p.r. to switch to new commands library

    - `--cid-base` p.r. is now blocked on switch to commands library which
      is mostly being done based on an outside contributor @overbool

  - Question:
    - I really want to get the commands lib. stuff in ASAP, at what point
      should I take
      over the p.r. if @overbool is not responding,
      (especially the ones that require a use of PostRun)
  - Next:
    - Continue reviewing commands lib. P.R.
    - Maybe spend some more time figure out how IPFS works at the network
      layer so
      I can come up with a solution to the provder problem on my own

### Questions
- @eingenito how are things added to the Global Priorities list? Many of the bullet points for PL priorities seem pretty aspirational even for a 1 year plan, and many of them have no clear owners. I will ask in the doc. 
- @eingenito who can help me with the blog? @stebalien pointed out that PRs to the blog are built and published by Jenkins and are linked to in the check's section of the Github PR page. That was my question - I just wanted other people to be able to see the page rendered and I couldn't figure out how to build it myself (because of chanllenges with hugo - the blog build tool). 

### Other notes
- @eingenito Don't forget the Roadmap!: https://docs.google.com/document/d/11zw8H8NjUzMM5CJ1y9lpvDxmVrJ6SAOxsRsiLPZxDaI/edit#heading=h.3o5e0g37o69l
