**Discussion Highlights**

-   We started thinking about OKRs (Q4 retro + Q1 planning)
    -   Parent issue: <https://github.com/ipfs/team-mgmt/issues/792> 
    -   Date to remember: OKR draft reporting will be on 19th
    -   Async retrospective retro & planning: [in-web-browsers/issues/136](https://github.com/ipfs/in-web-browsers/issues/136) 
    -   Friday: score Q4 and do personal retro, create Q1 OKR draft
    -   Monday: continue Q1 OKR planning
-   IPFS Companion
    -   MVP window.ipfs.enable will land soon: early preview in PR [ipfs-companion/pull/619](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/pull/619) 
        -   tl;dr ask IPFS Proxy for a list of permissions and user will accept them in bulk.
        -   This gives developer full control on when permission prompt is displayed
        -   We want to improve UX of the permission prompt, for now it has the old look._Feedback/suggestions/mockups are welcome!_
-   IPFS Web UI
    -   Removed CountryGraph from status to solve issues described in [ipfs-webui/issues/848](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-webui/issues/848) 
        -   Web UI will no longer generate huge traffic due to geoip requests to an empty IPFS repo
    -   Improved onboarding of new users (‚Äúam I connected?‚Äù)
        -   Status page includes connection confirmation, and inviting files and peers info
    -   Usability sessions in progress (2 next week)
    -   A new release will happen after we update IPLD and other libraries
-   IPFS Desktop
    -   Merged: Removed the need of setting of CORS headers on ipfs daemon - [ipfs-desktop/pull/740](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop/pull/740) 
    -   Merged: Improved cleanup of lock files - [ipfs-desktop/pull/722](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop/pull/722)
    -   Release plan:
        -   We want to ensure from now on, Windows and Mac users will get auto-updated (Linux users will usually use distro-specific package)
        -   Cut pre-relase to test auto-update
        -   Install on ipfs-gui team machines.
        -   Make a simple change and cut another release and test the update mechanism
        -   Make a proper release and share with IPFS org.
        -   Get PR to ipfs.io website with links to companion & desktop merged
        -   Update docs.ipfs.io about desktop (and webui)
        -   Write blog-post, tweet, and share with IPFS weekly newsletter
        -   What else would make for a great Desktop release?
            -   Idea: &lt;1m video showing installation + opening webui from IPFS Desktop on Mac and Windows to demonstrate how easy it is to get it going
-   The new implementation section on ipfs.io website ([ipfs/website/pull/282](https://github.com/ipfs/website/pull/282) ) is ready but we park it until IPFS Desktop is released with working auto-update :)
-   Honorable mention: Oli lost his voice while explaining IPFS to people
-   [proto.school](https://proto.school) 
    -   Saving state and CID updates are merged
    -   WIP on restructuring entire website to have more sections than current workshops
-   DDC WG looking into using Companion on peer-\*: [ipfs-companion/issues/634](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/issues/634)
-   Discussion: points of centralization and infra needs around share.ipfs.io (WIP)
    -   Proposal for infra team: <https://github.com/ipfs/infra/issues/461> 
    -   We want to end up with a good explanation of what config and machines we need to run a good / performant service.
    -   We can work with ipfs core and infra to define it, and it will form a useful checklist / educational component.
    -   We must clearly call out what centralised points there are (ws-\* or preload nodes), and what guarantees they have (currently none, we can‚Äôt build a service on that, but we can work to set a sensible one one up)
    -   Solutions:
        -   UX/copy: communicate points of centralization to users and explain why we need to have them (lack of relevant web standards, performance).
            -   There is a great story there for startups that start with own semi-centralized architecture, because nobody cares about their data, but as they grow IPFS swarm will take care of scaling and persistence.
        -   In parallel, look into technical solutions
            -   Measure SLA of preload nodes, ws-star
            -   Don‚Äôt fail js-ipfs start if ws-tar is down? Make it possible to connect to multiple ws-stars at the same time?
                -   Caveat: be mindful if it is worth investing time in things that will be superseded by autorelay and DHT.
            -   js-ipfs 0.34 may not have DHT in browser yet ( "js-libp2p-ipfs-browser will only add DHT there after Relay is in")
