-   _Delegated peer & content routing_
-   _DHT INTEROP!!_
-   _Delegated routing helps for browser nodes and low resource nodes. It allows a node to delegate to another node to do the work of finding and fetching content on their behalf_
-   _Delegated routing example<https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/tree/ae513887f5d90afeb1bc14764800dcca5cad2346/examples/delegated-routing>_
-   _Circuit Relay is on by default._
-   _Js-libp2p and js-libp2p-switch refactored to be state machines along with the connections themselves, and much richer debug logging, for every state transition._
-   _Delegated providers will fetch the content from you and provide it on your behalf… this is similar to the idea of a pinning service._
-   _If you run a libp2p relay node, there is currently no way to limit which nodes you will relay for… you are relaying for the greater good_
-   _Check out uTP https&#x3A;//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Transport_Protocol_
