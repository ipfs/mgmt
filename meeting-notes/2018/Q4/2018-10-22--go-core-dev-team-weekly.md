### Other notes

Molly: It's useful to shift this meeting towards more of a traditional stand up, i.e. highlight blockers and briefly mention what you'll be working on. What you've done last week can be found in these notes :)

Steven will be cutting a new release this week‚Äîspeak now or forever hold your peace.

Adin: go-libp2p-examples have atrophied and need attention. Cole will take a look at merging fixes/migrating fixes from go-libp2p.

Group discussion: The new format will be that everyone can propose difficult/important topics for group discussion. Similarly, big blockers from everyone's updates will bubble up to this queestion list. Once everyone is done giving their brief updates (blockers/futfutpbrief plan for this week), we can move on to this group discussion with our valuable synchronous time!
