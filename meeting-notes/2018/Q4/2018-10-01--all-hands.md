- (@mkg20001, 30sec) Trying to make aegir cli-tool smaller through bundling

    - AEgir is used by the JS team
    - Been working on this on-and-off for about half a year, but would love some feedback!
    - Trying to make the tool smaller (as far as file size and file count)
    - **Would love some help here, too!**
    - <https://github.com/ipfs/aegir>
    - <https://github.com/ipfs/aegir/issues/215>

- What is the Zoom number?

    - <https://protocol.zoom.us/j/443621844> Make sure you use the community calendar in case you have copied the calendar to your own.
    - In the community calendar, the Zoom number is in the “location” field.

        - Would be nice to repeat the link in the meeting body for extra clarity since the “location” doesn’t turn link-color
