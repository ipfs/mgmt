### Questions
- What are the timeline expectations around the async iterator awesome endeavor?
  - We'd like to start working on the dependencies first, like multiformats, and start working our way to js-ipfs. We don't want to disrupt OKR work, and we should be trying to work this in as a part of the 40% tiemme we should have after commiting to our OKRs (at 60%) time.
  - Should see more planning around APIs this quarter (Q4 2018) and implementations next quarter (Q1 2018).

### Other notes
- Discussion around using major semver versions for js-ipfs dependencies was tabled as we were running short on time.

<!-- After each call, the notetaker submits a PR to ipfs/pm to store the notes on the meeting-notes folder -->
