### Discussion Highlights âœ¨

- [IPFS Companion shipped with Web UI v2.2](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/releases/tag/v2.6.2)
- Initial poc&success with [exposing API of js-ipfs running inside of Service Worker to a third-party website](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/service-worker-gateway/issues/30) (different Origin) over iframe proxy.
    - This is part of "window.ipfs 2.0 / fallback-lib" OKR, the goal is to get a better understanding of existing constraints across vendors in available Web APIs for creating alternative "API providers". 
    - Remaining work is to check if multiple websites embedding such iframe will share instance/repository/storage. 
    - If time allows, split @lidel's sandbox into comprehensible examples.
- Origin Trial of [Signed HTTP Exchanges](https://github.com/ipfs/in-web-browsers/issues/121) should land next week.
    - We are just waiting for HTTP headers to land - [ipfs/infrastructure/issues/453](https://github.com/ipfs/infrastructure/issues/453)

    - New copy for upload and download screen
    - We will add i18n soon
    - Discovery speed without local daemon needs some extra work
        - There should be some UI indication that something is happening behind the scenes
