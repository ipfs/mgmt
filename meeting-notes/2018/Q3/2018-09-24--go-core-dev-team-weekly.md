@kevina
 - Done:
   - Phase 1 of Base32 migration done once p.r are in:
     - GitHub issue blocking review of `ipfs cid` sub-commands seams to be fixed
     - Created P.R. for `--cid-base` and `--upgrade-cid` options
       (https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/5464) 
   - Phase 2:
     - Started work on Switching Blockstore to use multihashes instead of Cids
     (https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/5510)
 - Blocked:
   - Still need code review on `ipfs cid` commands p.r.
     (https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/5385)
   - Need code review on `--cid-base` and `--upgrade-cid` options p.r
     (https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/5464)
   - Several issues came up for Switching Blockstore to multihash
     that I need feedback on (mentioned in p.r.), most pressing:
      - Dag service has delete methods, this will create problems if it backed by a Blockstore based on multihash
      - Bitswap: Do we ever publish the list of all blocks in the blockstore, if so this will create problems as we
          no longer have full CIDs available, just multihashes.
 - Next:
   - Continue pussing through already mentioned open p.r.
   - Possibily right up my thoughts on pinning and related
   - Possibly Merge and bubble-up switch to go-multihash string representation (https://github.com/multiformats/go-multihash/pull/84)
 - Notes:
   - Issue to track migration to base32 progress: https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/5358
   - All base32 related issues/p.r. in go-ipfs: https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/labels/cidv1b32

### Questions

### Other notes

Remember to check out the OKR PR (https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/5474) and indicate what you'd like to work on for the next quarter, and (if it's not the same) what you think is important for the team to work on in general. Thanks!

Notes on PR Reviewing (@eingenito to PR this to go contributing guidelines - https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/go-code-guidelines.md)
- All questions are good! Goal is to understand if all code is both sufficient and necessary, and first few rounds can just be adding more info to the PR via clarifications
- Block out time for actually going as deep as possible through the code paths
- Are there tests?  Do they run?
- Pair-reviewing to explain things to each other can make it more comfortable to get into the code
- Can reference js guidelines at ()https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/js-code-guidelines.md)
