    -   <https://github.com/ipfs/pm/issues/698>

        -   There are links in issue #698 to examples and templates!
        -   A long doc that talks about 2 things: planning the next quarter and a retrospective of last quarter
        -   OKRs should be created and discussed publicly; useful to create them as PRs, to allow us and the community to get the most important items added to the next quarter

            -   Google docs, hack pads, etc, that are publicly accessible.

        -   Want to complete the OKRs by**October 1st**
        -   Retrospective gives us the opportunity to reflect on how the last quarter went and what we can do to improve going forward
        -   We should ensure we are scoring last quarters OKRs to help keep track of how well we’re hitting our target goals

-   (@lidel, 2mins) Even more Cloudflare fun!

    -   Cloudflare’s StackExchange-on-IPFS with search:<https://blog.cloudflare.com/e2e-integrity/> 
    -   People can use DNSLink to point a url to a static site hosted on IPFS

        -   <https://developers.cloudflare.com/distributed-web/ipfs-gateway/connecting-website/> 
        -   Lots of good documents on setting a site up via the above links
        -   Free certificate for DNSLink-enabled websites

    -   Gateway endpoints are apparently distributed across their CDN.

- @jamiew: I noticed OKR docs are not public, was that intentional?
  - OKR docs should be public. Feel free to reach out via <https://github.com/ipfs/pm/issues/698> or the relevant linked OKR Issues if the specific doc you are trying to access is not public.
