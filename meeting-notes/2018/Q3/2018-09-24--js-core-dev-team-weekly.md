### Questions

- @diasdavid: FOSS4G talk re-recording why? - not all talks recorded - @vmx re-recording

- @diasdavid: can we ensure any prototype of GraphSync works with IPFS so we can grab all usecases and have real tests on the network

- @alanshaw: can we get some more visibility on GraphSync? Live demo or pre-recorded video. Seeing the process that @vmx is going through is interesting and will provide @vmx feedback to improve it and keep motivation levels high!

- @mikeal: would like to see the changes GraphSync has gone through and why. Changes speak to fundamental architectural issues that we'll run into in the future. We need to know the reason why these approcahes were not taken, maybe they won't work or they won't scale, either way it'll help repeating work in the future.

- @hugomrdias: needs advice on what to do with releasing ipfsd-ctl, the pregenerated IDs do not appear to have any performance gain https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfsd-ctl/issues/295, but the work has been merged already and @hugomrdias wants to release a new version with dependency updates

- @pgte: What's the status of rendezvous protocol RFC? https://github.com/libp2p/specs/pull/56 - Would love to work on that / help out. @victorbjelkholm: There's comments in a PR on that repo to adjust the spec (needs review). There's a go implementation and a testing server you can use. There's also a js implementation built by @mkg20001.
