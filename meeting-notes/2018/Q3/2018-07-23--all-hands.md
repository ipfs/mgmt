## Q&A, Help Wanted

_Ask questions, get answers. Announce issues that need help, get people to help._

-   What happens on ipfs where there’s a place you want to go a lot, but the content changes? Such as the New York Times when the content changes

    -   IPNS is content addressable, so if the content changes you can update the IPNS record to point to the new content

-   Does the new protocol handler have a link limit? (As in length)

    -   I don’t think so, we have not tried it.
