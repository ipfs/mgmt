## Notes

### Week Update

@vmx
  - Done:
    - (already last week): Describe your DAG in a text file: https://github.com/vmx/dagbuilder
    - Hello world libp2p (for GraphSync)
    - FOSS4G talk preparations
  - Blocked: nope
  - Next:
    - FOSS4G conference + holidays (will be away till 2018-09-09)

@jacobheun
  - Done:
    - Released [multistream-select@0.14.3](https://github.com/multiformats/js-multistream-select/commit/64206162b525ba841e77dd4a6caa3a73b020e089) to prevent 'already piped' errors from crashing daemons.
    - Release of libp2p@v0.23.1, which includes @alanshaws fix for bad multiaddrs throwing errors instead of calling back.
    - Created [ipfs-api#837](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-api/pull/837) to make mocking the api requests easier, which should make it easier to create tests without spinning up full nodes.
    - libp2p factory is ready to merge [js-ipfs#1470](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/1470)
    - delegate peer routing test updates are ready to merge https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-delegated-peer-routing/pull/3
    - Found an inconsistency issue when adding libp2p tests for delegate content routing.  Fixed that, going to finish the libp2p tests for that today.
  - Blocked:
    - Go delegate route endpoints https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/4595. We can get the work finished for delegated peer/content routing, but it won't be functional until this is deployed.
    - [ipfs-api#837](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-api/pull/837) will prevent me from finalizing my PR for libp2p content/delegate routing tests.
  - Next:
    - Finish libp2p tests for peer/content routing
    - Create example for peer/content routing
    - Going to look into js-ipfs-repo configuration updates that need to happen to help unblock the ipfs-repo interop [[awesome endeavor](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/1467)
    - Start work on libp2p and libp2p-switch state machine work.

### Questions
- What is the DAG Builder for?
  - Makes it easy to test graphs, so you don't have to make it manually.
- Should there be an issue tracking that we don't publish `dist` directories of the examples?
  - https://github.com/ipfs/testing/issues/129
- @mgoelzer want to createa a demo of the various libp2p nodes all connecting together, is that possible?
  - The ipfs nodes are talking together already, so it works, it's really just a matter of what fun things you'll find along the way as we don't have interop tests currently running for each of the versions. Interop tests are in the pipeline to complete this quarterh , although they will probably be delayed.

### Other notes
- Meeting ended ubruptly due to another meeting being started that ended this one.

<!-- After each call, the notetaker submits a PR to ipfs/pm to store the notes on the meeting-notes folder -->
