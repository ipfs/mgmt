## Agenda

- Ask everyone to put their name into the list of attendees
- Ask for a Notetaker
- Mid Quarter OKR Review Day

## Notes

** npm on ipfs **
* Follow up with infra team on getting a machine/container setup so that we can run npm on ipfs.
	* Potentially run a local node pointing at an s3 bucket for block storage
  * Concerns around reliability of the deploy rather than running locally

** iptb **
* Hoping to decrease the scope of the current PR to allow the existing (core) changes to move forward, then focus on plugins later
  * Lots of code changed so the PR has been dragging along, overall it's going well.
  * @daviddias showing demos of your work can help get things pushed forward sometimes. 
  * There is one! Link forthcoming!
  
** libp2p **
* Focus on higher priority items while we start discussions with the go team on the items that need cross cutting discussions (api for the libp2p daemons as an example)

**@alanshaw (not attending)**

- **A Daemon runs for 10 days without a crash**
  - Done
    - Improper validation of inputs can crash the daemon. It's unlikely to have fixed every problem, but it's a start [#1506](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/1506) and [#232](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/pull/232)
  - Todo
    - Setup a public facing js-ipfs daemon and see how long it lasts. Hook it up to an error reporter and address the errors that cause crashes
    - Identify, test, and fix more of the causes of crashes. I have so far:
      - Improper input validation
      - `throw new Error` instead of `callback(new Error)`
      - Double piping aka "Already piped" - [yes still an issue](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/1446#issuecomment-411402398)
- **js-ipfs fully support uses base32 CIDv1 by default**
  - Done
    - I'm following the activity from @kevina wrt this work for go-ipfs
    - No further progress other than baby steps towards goal [#1441](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/1441)
  - Todo
    - Step 1 - allow CID base as option, dual check in blockstore/bitswap for requested CIDs (after adding interop tests for CID retrieval)
    - Step 2 - change default to base32 CIDv1
    - See https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/1440#issuecomment-407343797
- **Cut CI testing time in js-ipfs and js-ipfs-api by 50% (2x)**
  - Done
    - Proposed a new pipeline that would mean tests complete faster [#73](https://github.com/ipfs/testing/issues/73). Sadly this is **BLOCKED** on a Jenkins issue
  - Todo
    - Helping @mkg20001 to land re-usable private keys [#1485](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/1485)
    - Identify and resolve more bottlenecks that are causing the tests to take so long



Following dweb summit I've been spending some time implementing a MDNS discovery and TCP transport that uses **libdweb**:

* https://github.com/alanshaw/js-libp2p-webext-mdns
* https://github.com/alanshaw/js-libp2p-webext-tcp

These can be used with the embedded js-ipfs node that runs in IPFS companion to give it basically the same powers as js-ipfs running in Node.js. Obviously this includes local network discovery of JS or Go nodes but also p2p communication without websockets. This would be so AWESOME.

I think it's important that these libp2p modules exist for IPFS and I think that IPFS (the organisation) using, testing and approving libdweb will hopefully make it a little more likely to be accepted into Firefox and then maybe adopted by Chrome and others.
