  - Update: 
    - Will continue to work on delegated routing this week. Encountered an issue with the example late last week where the api connection stays open when finding providers and the total number of providers is < 20. This will need to get fixed before we deploy this so we don't hold open http connections to the delegated peers.

### Questions

### Other notes

- Victor presented a framework to generate all the HTTP/CLI commands (branch:  chore/deduuplicate).  He will open a PR soon.

- Victor:  tests on js-ipfs have not been passing for some at least a month; he cannot get the tests to pass locally
	- Vasco:  usually all green for me locally, but does not work in CI
  - Victor:  think it's timeouts, but Vasco will re-test locally
  - Tests currently take 40 minutes

- Next week:
