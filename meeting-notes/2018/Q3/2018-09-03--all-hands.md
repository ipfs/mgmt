## Agenda

_General discussions, decisions, etc._

- @lidel, 5min PSA: Starting Translation Project for IPFS GUIs,

    Looking for some feedback at <https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-gui/issues/50>

    - Consolidating translation work across all GUIs, e.g. IPFS Companion, IPFS Desktop, Web UI, etc.
        - Right now you can translate by making PRs to various projects
        - Want to add crowdsourcing

            - Evaluating Transifex vs. CrowdIn
            - Want to choose one for all IPFS projects so we can share work, resources, and translations
            - Eventually add automation for pushing strings to translate to crowdsourcing site and pulling results in to the code for releases
            - **If you have experience with any of these platforms or thoughts about them, weâ€™d love feedback and comments on the issue!** (linked above)

        - Question: what about CLI apps? (@Mr0grog)

            - I think we can probably do that too, via gettext
            - Also docs! Split it into sections and paragraphs and translate those.

- @momack2: Take a look at e-mail from @Daviddias on state of contributors and project

    - This was go-ipfs focused (e-mail was to members of the Golang core dev team)
    - Maybe a good idea to do something similar for Libp2p
    - Proposal for maybe having a hack week after the next Protocol Labs Team week

        - Debating Porto vs. Glasgow for this; concerns about physical distance from PL Team Week meetings
