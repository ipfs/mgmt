    -   <https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/3935> 
    -   Working on adding our protocols to WHATWG HTML Spec (<https://html.spec.whatwg.org/>), so that we can get support for ipfs://, etc, linking in html.
    -   Intent to implement from the Chromium team with one positive review

        -   Historically there was opposition as the spec team wanted to wait for vendors and vendors wanted to implement the to spec

## Demos

_Show your work!_

-   (pre-recorded demo by @alanshaw)  
    libdweb and JS IPFS in webextension with MDNS discovery and TCP transport \\o/<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDHFqwC8Syg> 

    -   About 15 minutes long, showcases how we’re able to get some things that we’d normally only get in nodejs (like TCP) running in the browser via the libdweb libraries
    -   Does this pave the way for improving communication, ie dht?

        -   Doesn’t so much pave the way as it gives us the ability to do what we can already do in nodejs, which opens up the ability for js-ipfs to talk more freely with other nodes. There’s a possibility libdweb might make it into firefox, which is a next step into getting it implemented into other browsers.

    -   Needs more exposure. People using it, blog posts, etc, to get the word out so that Mozilla see’s more people using it.
    -   Currently requires the nightly build of Firefox to use libdweb
    -   We could make a blog post on ipfs.io about libdweb. Mozilla appreciates when people are talking about using libdweb.

        -   We need to sort out the MDNS spec so that we improve our ability to connect to any ipfs node (js, go, etc).

  


-   @Hsanjuan: ipfs-cluster-ctl add demo:<https://asciinema.org/a/M5ZBzxAWvNwqUaYPYPE25JW81>

    -   Demo shows ipfs-cluster doing multiple pins across a specified number of nodes
