    - What is the next important thing you should focus on?
- Read updates of others
    - Any there any questions, requests to communicate?


### Regular

- Ask everyone to put their name into the list of attendees
- Go over everyone's updates and ask if there are any questions or things to discuss

### Notes from Agenda

- DWeb Summit & Lab Day in San Francisco
  - DWeb Summit
    - An 1h  block of IPFS Lightning Talks from first day of DWeb Summit 2018 starts at https://youtu.be/eO6pYYWZBs8?t=545
    - There is one 6h+ video per every room  per every day: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFa_X02QhJnP0FNpFAKyRRg/videos
      - list of talks and room info is at https://decentralizedwebsummit2018.sched.com, so it may be possible to find other IPFS talks that way
  - Lab Day was also recorded, videos will be published at https://www.youtube.com/c/IPFS-dweb/videos when ready
- New APIs (libdweb)
  - current approach is to design and smoke test new APIs in Firefox, IPFS and others demonstrate value added by those APIs by using them in our extensions, then other vendors have 1) API spec ready to implement 2) set of extensions that already consume those API
  - @lidel created short doc on running Companion with mozilla/libdweb: https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/blob/libdweb/docs/libdweb.md
    - initial run of `npm run libdweb` takes a bit time (it downloads nightly and libdweb), but then its just `npm run libdweb:firefox`  to start it next time
  - Local Discovery in Web Browsers    
    We want to make js-ipfs compliant with mDNS implementation that follow DNS-SD, so we can use [mDNS API from mozilla/libdweb](https://github.com/mozilla/libdweb/issues/7) and get LAN discovery \o/
      - For background, see ongoing discussion Future of mDNS discovery in IPFS:
        - https://github.com/libp2p/libp2p/issues/28
        - https://github.com/libp2p/specs/pull/80
  - libp2p, mdns and TCP Socket API
    - @alanshaw noted we can inject custom configuration for libp2p when starting js-ipfs, which makes webext-only mdns and tcp transports much easier to ship
- IPFS Desktop
  - DWeb people been asking about IPFS Desktop app, we will probably focus on it as soon WebUI is in 'shippable' state (potential OKR for Q4)
  - Release notes will have a note about which go-ipfs version is shipped with it
  - At some point in future we will be looking into making it possible to switch to node-based js-ipfs as an alternative to  go-ipfs
