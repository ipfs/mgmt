     - @stebalien says: See https://github.com/whyrusleeping/gx/issues/179#issuecomment-408243162
       - The thought here is to turn gx into a "lockfile" manager and allow users to use their language's package manager for everything else.

 - Next:
   - Schedule to speak with David :^)
   - Impliment writable support for `ipfs mount`
   - Finish remaining Windows tagged `go-ipfs` issues, allowing me to switch focus to:
     - Other tasks (discuss with the team where we're lacking and see if I can fill)
     - Other platforms (BSD, Solaris, Haiku, Plan9, et al.)
     - Other Archs (arm, ppc, z/OS, pdp11, etc.)

### Questions

### Other notes

**Base32 CidV1 Progress:**

@kevina has been working steadly toward the goal to switch to base32.  Go-ipfs now can retrive a block regadress of what CID version it is in.

He has created a a meta issue for tracking the progress in go-ipfs: https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/5358

He will continue to work steadly towards the goal but needs feedback on several issues:
  * Handling of Alternative Multibases [#5349](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/5349) _(could use feedback from: @Stebalien @lidel @lgierth)_
  * How to handle CIDv0 as we migrate to CIDV1 [#5291](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/5291) _(could use feedback from: @whyrusleeping @Stebalien)_
  * Create config option for specifying full default cidv1 parameters [#5230](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/5230) _(could use feedback from: @whyrusleeping @daviddias)_
  
#5349 and #5230 and are the most pressing and blocking full multibase support in go-ipfs.  #5291 is less pressing but he would really appeciate @daviddias and @whyrusleeping insight.

For all issues and p.r. related to Base32 CidV1 search using the `cidv1b32` tag: https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/labels/cidv1b32
