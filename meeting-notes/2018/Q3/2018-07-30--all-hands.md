## Demos

_Show your work!_

- @mkg20001,<https://test-peer-ids.tk>: Get peer-ids generated instantly

    - Generate a batch of peer IDs in advance, should all be unique
    - Use case is for testing
    - Also supports 16k IDs, but you probably shouldn’t use that in production
    - @diasdavid: this is super full-featured, but for a lot of test cases, it would be great to have a nice NPM module or something that can be depended on and used locally
    - @mkg20001: I have another module named aegir-keycache that stores IDs on disk after generating them<https://npm.im/aegir-keycache>

- @Aaron Taylor: Introducing myself, I’m from Diffeo, a company that is starting to do a lot of decentralized data & search work

    - <https://diffeo.com>
    - We don’t have a lot published about our move into the decentralized space online yet

- @diasdavid: Introducing the new awesome-ipfs<https://awesome.ipfs.io/>

    - Lists neat apps, libraries, projects, websites, blog posts, tutorials, etc. about IPFS
    - This used to just be a GitHub README, but is now a nice looking, searchable website
    - Please add new projects to it! Go to<https://github.com/ipfs/awesome-ipfs> and follow the contribution guidelines

- @flyingzumwalt: Mapping the decentralized web:<https://kumu.io/DigLife/decentralized-tech>

    - Announcing this at the summit
    - Still sort of an alpha
    - Attempting to map, relate, and link different projects in the IFPS space.
    - Please submit your projects here, too (similar to awesome-ipfs)

        - @diasdavid: how do we add?
        - @flyingzumwalt: You can update the entries, or submit JSON for new entries, by editing/creating JSON files in<https://github.com/DigitalLifeCollective/mapped-projects/tree/development/>projects and submitting a PR. There is also a form for creating/submitting new entries at<https://forms-diglife.herokuapp.com/#/form/11f40902f7c7485e> -- this generates the JSON for you and submits it to the maintainers via email.

            - Try using the form first to get a sense for how you would format JSON

        - @jamiewilkinson: Looks like they have a public Discourse install as well –<https://discuss.diglife.com/>
