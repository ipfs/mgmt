## Notes

### Week Update

@name

@djdv
 - Done:
   - Refined the IPFS on fuse implementation
     - Added caching around things like pins, keys, and metadata
     - Reduced lock contention
     - Reworked how indexes are generated and referenced
    - Added fs stat data
      - free space remaining on daemon's datastore device
      - available file descriptors/handles
    - Partial symlink support
      - they work with *nix tools and Go's os pkg but not win32
 - Blocked:
   - Previously I wanted to work on write support, but was blocked on an issue related to file permissions
     - This was resolved while refactoring
   - Currently I'm dealing with an issue related to file ownership
     - I am currently in contact with the cgofuse developer about it
     - Currently working around this by setting everything to 0777, later node owners will be the same as the process owner/invoker
 - Next:
   - Add create, write, and delete methods for MFS
   - Experiment with mutable methods in non-mutable areas
     - rmdir/del -> unpin; for files directly under the ipfs root
     - write -> add -w

@schomatis (not attending)
 - Done:
   - `gx`: 
     - Unify dependency fetching in `gx` (https://github.com/whyrusleeping/gx/pull/197)
     - Review part of the documentation (https://github.com/whyrusleeping/gx/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Adocumentation).
   - Encourage some community contribution.
   - In progress: Badger integrity (`go-ipfs`: #5213, #5280) and memory (#5177, #5390) issues.
   	- - Notes from @bigs:
     	 - When Commit(nil) returns (as we have it implemeneted in go-ds-badger), entries have been committed to the WAL at least and should be truncate-safe.
 - Next:
   - Ease the use of `gx-go link` when dependencies don't match, e.g., developing in `go-unixfs` and testing in `go-ipfs` (https://github.com/whyrusleeping/gx-go/issues/46).
   - Keep working on `gx` docs and code clarity.
   - Incorporate the feedback of the DAG traversal PR (https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/5257) and split it in the corresponding repos (`go-unixfs` and `go-ipld-format`). PR under review.

@stebalien
 - Done:
   - IPLD:
     - thinking through go-ipld interfaces from a performance perspective (no concrete progress)
     - have a plan to fix the interfaces and move to the IPLD org: https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld/issues/2
   - fix (in review): stop go-libp2p from NAT port mapping non-nat (e.g., localhost) addresses.
   - fix (in review): stop go-ipfs from listening on random ports.
   - misc fixes, reviews, gx
 - Next:
   - multistream-select (again)

### Questions

### Other notes

**Base32 CidV1 Progress:**

_(Mostly Copied From Last Week)_

@kevina has been working steadily toward the goal to switch to base32.  Go-ipfs now can retrieve a block regardless of what CID version it is in.

He has created a a meta issue for tracking the progress in go-ipfs: https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/5358

He will continue to work steadily towards the goal but needs feedback on several issues:
  * Handling of Alternative Multibases [#5349](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/5349) _(could use feedback from: @Stebalien @lidel @lgierth)_
  * How to handle CIDv0 as we migrate to CIDV1 [#5291](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/5291) _(could use feedback from: @whyrusleeping @Stebalien)_
  * Create config option for specifying full default cidv1 parameters [#5230](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/5230) 
  
#5349 and #5230 and are the most pressing and blocking full multibase support in go-ipfs.  #5291 is less pressing but he would really appeciate @daviddias and @whyrusleeping insight.

For all issues and p.r. related to Base32 CidV1 search using the `cidv1b32` tag: https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/labels/cidv1b32
