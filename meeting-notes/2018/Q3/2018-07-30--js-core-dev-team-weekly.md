### Questions

* Shall we run our tests in service worker also (@alanshaw)?
  - Yes, we should run this in ci , we will need to make updates to aegir.
* (@diasdavid -> @jacobheun) Look into circuit relay issues, there seems to be some issues talking with other nodes and this may create issues doing the delegated routing.

- @jacobheun out Aug 1 - Aug 8
