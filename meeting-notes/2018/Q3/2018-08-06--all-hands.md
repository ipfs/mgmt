## Notes:

- **_Format Switch_**_: @flyingzumwalt discussed the format switch to be formatted around presenter, with 20 presentation including Q and A followed by Demo and community announcements. @item: Rob, Dom and Matt to coordinate via email_
- _**Demo** by @lidel for ipfs-companion: libdweb is community effort on mozilla, goal is to create common api on browsers, same connectivity magic in browser. Works in Firefox nightly ( well.. at least from last week ). Gives you ipfs:// and ipns:// in browser, localStorage works as expected, local directory traversal works. Streaming protocol with progressive download. Javascript works as expected. All of the pages that have dns link work fine, e.g. Turkey wikipedia works. Most everything loads. Very exciting!_

    - _@flyingzumwalt: What will it take to get it to work in main firefox?_

        - _Right now it is a prototype to work out the issues_
        - _Beneficial to check if your ipns website works as dweb centric_
        - _Problems playing video, how to we address http video links?_
        - _Send issues to @Lidel, try to break things_
        - _When it is promoted to firefox proper and w3c just need to implement api_
