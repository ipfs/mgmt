## Notes

@daviddias 
 -	Next release (0.29) by Wednesday if everything goes well
  
@vmx
 - Next up finish the Flow Typing
 - Conferences and some other things coming up the next two weeks - might not be always available
 - Priority is to focus on GraphSync
  
@dryajov
 - Drop notes about NAT traversal using upnp and pmp on issue created.

@fsdiogo
 - Suggestion: isolate possible error cases and create script to automate testing, instead of just manually trying all options. This way it is easier to test things out in the future. (context?) 

@hugomrdias
 - Connection management repo maintainer?
 - Setting up test bed for big files testing might be ready in next 1/1.5 weeks
 - It would be cool to have the visuals (context?) more available to developers.
 
@mkg20001
 - It would be useful to see more demos - even if it ends up beign similar to previous ones.
 - Discuss with @diasdavid about more issues to work on!

   - Looked into issue with big.js using esmodules breaking our build, [submitted a PR](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/1364) so other modules don't also break us
   - Found an [issue with the ping tests](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/1342/commits/1c8eccf6e068301e30d02c2d4a58bbe0f901b75f) - pings can take less than 1ms to pong - tests were assuming they would take at least 1ms
   - Resolved a few issues
     - [Java IPFS API client calls wrong HTTP endpoint](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/1362)
     - [`ipfs-pubsub-room` unsubscribes pubsub handlers after IPFS node is stopped](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/1330)

   - [Submitted a PR for passing your own IPFS API constructor to `js-ipfsd-ctl`](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfsd-ctl/pull/261) - it means that we eventually won't have to wait for PRs for upgrading `js-ipfs-api` to be merged in `js-ipfsd-ctl` for the tests in `js-ipfs` to pass

### Questions

- (from last week) Why not release `1.0.0` of our modules? (@diasdavid to clarify)
  - https://github.com/jbenet/random-ideas/issues/35
  
R: Modules may be feature compliant but since IPFS is still alpha, it's better to not release 1.0.0+ modules to avoid confusion.
  
- ws-star: Shouldn't it be dead half a year ago? Should it be still maintained? (@mkg20001)

R: ws-star is still useful in certain scnarios and it is still being used. There must be some migration plan in place in the future before total discontinuation.

- public gateways: use something like https://sentry.io to track errors more efficently? (@mkg20001)

R: Infra repo documentation should have more information on what tools are being used at the moment. Suggestions/discussion open issue on repo

### Other notes

- The number of issues on `Inbox` -- https://waffle.io/ipfs/js-waffle -- are pilling up. Lead Maintainers, please label the issues accordingly. (@diasdavid)

Suggestion: Everyone would take 10m or so per day to curate their issues, to reach waffle-zero :)

<!-- After each call, the notetaker submits a PR to ipfs/pm to store the notes on the meeting-notes folder -->
