## Agenda

-   @Mr0grog: Future notetakers can use <https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPXwFruH72wk37Kp4sPHBDdgmaZvn75SB5D3p9zNYm3Ka/> to convert notes from here to markdown when adding them to the git repo. It’s also linked from the top of this doc and I’ll keep the link up to date if it changes.

        -   Mention the bot on twitter or @hsanjuan to get the bot to follow you
