## Notes

_Extracted from the meetings irc logs in #in-web-browsers_

### Browser Extension

* Researched `window.ipfs` perf
	* TLDR; the content scripts also add constructor @ `window.Ipfs`, this adds a **~500ms** delay, suggested removing it

### New WebUI

* Started work on WebUI 2.0 foundations
	* Tech Stack
		* Started by using Aegir found a few pain points
		* Looked into options for e2e testing and found Google's Puppeteer to be least flakey, quickest, and free
		* All findings written up here: https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/pm-ipfs-gui/issues/51#issuecomment-385425256
	* Reviewing wireframes
		*  [Drag and drop](https://invis.io/AVGRKKJ75KT#/293709612_File_screen_-_drag-drop_in_subfolder)
