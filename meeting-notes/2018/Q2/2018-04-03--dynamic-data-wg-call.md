## Notes

The main focus of the Dynamic Data WG is to create the necessary building blocks to create fully Distributed Apps, from Security, Authentication, Synchronization and more.

Pedro has created a ton of resources for newcomers to the working group to get started on Dynamic Data on IPFS space (e.g learn about CRDTs). Check out https://github.com/ipfs/dynamic-data-and-capabilities

In addition, we have now a list of open problems in the CRDT space. You can learn about those at https://github.com/ipfs/dynamic-data-and-capabilities/issues

   - Working on peer-crdt and peer-crdt-ipfs to solve [issue 1](https://github.com/ipfs/dynamic-data-and-capabilities/issues/1)
 - In progress:
   - CRDT over IPLD performance ([issue](https://github.com/ipfs/dynamic-data-and-capabilities/issues/3))
     - finished [ipfs-bitswap per peer stats](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-bitswap/issues/165), [PR here](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-bitswap/pull/166)
     - working on [libp2p-connection-manager](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-connection-manager)
 - Blocked:

 - Next:
   - finish first version of [libp2p-connection-manager](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-connection-manager)


### Questions

- Q: Some folks had issues with using some of the modules, can we get updates?
A: Yes, a new release happened today (@pgte was out for a week, sorry about the delay!)

- Q: Who is responsible for making releases in the dapps building blocks lands?
A: It is @pgte for now

- Q: How to autenticate peers that enter the PubSub broadcast tree?
A: We use a side chanel (the url #) to exchange a write/read key to other peers. Every peer uses those keys to make sure they only connect to the peers that belong to that topic/room

- Q: Where should we track research around CRDTs
A: Two main places right now:
- https://github.com/ipfs/dynamic-data-and-capabilities/issues
- https://github.com/ipfs/research-crdt/issues

Nevertheless, Authentication and Privacy is something that is not tackled by CRDTs by themselves, it requires to mix some more ingredients. 

- Q: What primitives do we need to build awesome Browser apps (from @diasdavid to the Web Browsers folks)
A: Authentication & Number f Peers in PUBSUB Room
