### Discussion Highlights

- Right now the entire team is in EU, so [we will move sync call to 9:30 AM UTC](https://github.com/ipfs/in-web-browsers/issues/106#issuecomment-419872656)
- [PR](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipld-explorer-components/pull/1/files) with a neat way of passing HTML tags (formatting, links) into ICU translation keys: `Some <0>stuff</1>, some <1>other</1> stuff`
- js-ipfs work related to cidv1b32 is progressing, adding support for `--cid-base` to all commands

- It is okay for landing page in Companion to give shell command example when API is off. We will make it more user-friendly when IPFS Desktop in refreshed version lands.
- We've identified [things that need to be done before we can ship WebUI](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-webui/issues/749).
