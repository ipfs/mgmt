## Notes

- multiformats
  - there's now github teams for all implementation languages, and contributor have proper access now
  - 14 language implementations of various multiformats libs :)
  - TODO need to update the implementation table
- js-ipfs git support
  - @magik6k added support for git repo traversal to the `js-ipfs dag` comments
  - on js-ipfs master, will be included in next release
- js-ipfs 0.26
  - github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/986
  - release hopefully this week
  - nice performance improvements
  - gateway \o/ we'll be running a few of these publicly
- ipfs in mexico
  - hackathon with consensys and microsoft
  - wanted to show state of the art of blockchain dev tools
  - almost every project needed to store data/documents
  - was surprised to see most people already knew about ipfs
  - TODO @hermanjunge place hackathon projects links here
- meetups in costa rica
  - connecting with people, getting the word out
  - will update once the first meetups takes place
  - create issue in ipfs/community repo
- py-ipfs
  - have been looking at ipfs for a while
  - looking into py-ipfs impl :)
  - implemented py-multibase and py-multicodec
  	- https://github.com/dhruvbaldawa/python-multibase/
    - https://github.com/dhruvbaldawa/python-multicodec/
- ipfs-companion
  - has been XUL-based classic firefox addon since the beginning
  - mozilla are phasing out the addon APIs in november
  - now: webextension
  - ipfs-companion works in both chrome and firefox
  - firefox still pending verification of the webextension...
  - that means for firefox you need to use the webextension's development channel
  - context menu lets you add e.g. images to local ipfs
  - should check out webextension support in edge, opera, safari
- relay / libp2p-circuit
  - if nodes can't communicate (e.g. nat, or no shared transports), the circuit relay comes into play
  - demo: browser<->go-ipfs via js-ipfs relay node
  - add file in the browser using the transfer-files example
  - connect browser node and go-ipfs to relay node
  - connect go-ipfs node to browser node
  - fetch file on the go-ipfs node \o/\o/\o/
  - credits: js-ipfs: @dryajov, go-ipfs: @vyzo
  - spec: https://github.com/libp2p/specs/tree/master/relay
- large files in the browser
  - browser crashes when adding large files :(
  - browserify-aes was making tons of object allocations => bad performance
  - also: tons of buffer operations (copy and concat)
  - @dignifiedquire took a look and improve the number of allocations => better performance, no more crashes
  - also: improved the number of buffer operations
  - targeting next js-ipfs release but will be tricky to get upstream releases by then
