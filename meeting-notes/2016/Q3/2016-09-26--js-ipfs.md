## Notes

Hi! (David), I won't be able to be present in an hangout, but I'll be present through chat. 

I've processed the js-ipfs waffle board and here are my notes:
- (a) ms2 has a lot of final low hanging fruit, namely
  - https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/495
  - https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/474
  - https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/478
  - https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-api/issues/365
  - https://github.com/ipfs/interface-ipfs-core/pull/36
  - https://github.com/ipfs/interface-ipfs-core/pull/37
  - https://github.com/ipfs/interface-ipfs-core/pull/38
  - https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/92
  - https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/213
  - https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/228
  - https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/229 (not really low hanging, but getting there)
  - https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/300

- (b) the last big piece for ms2 is really getting the interop tests + bitswap working at its fullest
  - https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/505
  - https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/498 

It would be super sweet if we can focus on these for this week, and check all of the boxes as soon as possible \o/

For ms3, IPLD, we have some great updates when it comes to interfaces, some of which related with this major refactor at https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec/pull/16, we are in the verge of getting an agnostic IPLD resolver. Working on getting it working for our dag-protobuf, dag-cbor and ethereum-block types.

Thank you for keeping the ship heading in the right direction, <3 y'all   

Updates:
    - Fixing interop problems with js-ipfs and go-ipfs
    - Victor is getting married!!!
    - Refractor crypto (https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/485 )
- @diasdavid and @jbenet spent a lot of time together bike shedding, excited to see the results of that conversation.

- Surprise: found a way to get webpack to work without any additional configuration
Pretty confident to ship js-ipfs and it's modules, if you bundle it if you use modern browser, it will work.
