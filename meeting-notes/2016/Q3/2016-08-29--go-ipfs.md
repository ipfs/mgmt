## Agenda
  - 0.4.3 review
  - js-ipfs interop milestone update
  - ipld milestone update

## Notes

- We've a "last mile" list of action items generated by Juan that need to happen before 0.4.3 release
- Some items will be ported to 0.4.4, which will be merged to master after 0.4.3 release
- js-ipfs interop
  - A new PR using the correct multicodecs is up
  - go-ipfs is going to support protocols with and without semver
  - current version of go-multistream is doing exact matching, however semver support is right there too, not the multivalidation mechanism required for the IPLD 

- We have a SECIO that works in js-ipfs, but it hasn't been tested for the go-ipfs platform
  - github issue here: https://github.com/ipfs/js-libp2p-ipfs/issues/15 (@whyrusleeping to create the scripts listed on that issue)
- multibase is implemented
- whyrusleeping has made a go-cid package
  - [ ] Create a README (@jbenet)
- go-cid will be integrated this week
  - replace the use of multihash by CIDs (because this is backwards compatible)
- Should peer-id change to use CID as well?
  - Discussion needs to happen
  - Let's piggyback on that discussion the change from /ipfs/ to /p2p/
- We are getting close to have 80% code coverage, this doesn't include the core/commands (the CLI). Next: figure out how to get code coverage from the sharness tests.

     - [ ] @em-ly yo update the github issue with what is in the google drive spreadsheet
