## Notes

 - There are currently two identities
 - the default identity
 - the identity that uport provides

 - Juan wants to talk about possible ideas with the Estonia IDs
  - Identity Providers issue -- https://github.com/haadcode/orbit/issues/86
  - Estonia E-ID - https://github.com/open-eid
  - NPAPI plugin: https://github.com/open-eid/browser-token-signing
  - Chrome extension: https://github.com/open-eid/chrome-token-signing
    - https://github.com/open-eid/chrome-token-signing/wiki

 - Could be used as a source to link your Orbit ID to
     - Orbit generates a key, saves the public key in IPFS
- Adds the hashable key to Orbit profile
 - Whatever we move to needs to have the same features and support as uport.

 - Concerns regarding passport?
From a tracking perspective, you dont want people to be able to link your account to a government identity (doxing)

 - Implementation Plan
 - Haad reviews libraries that have been put together and give his feedback
 - All depends on the quality of their libraries

Profiles:
    - We'll have to come up with a standard way of storing the profile data
    - See if we can keep it the same across these identity provider
     - We can try standardizing, but we're a little far off from having the identity profile solidified, but once we have that done we can go from there.
