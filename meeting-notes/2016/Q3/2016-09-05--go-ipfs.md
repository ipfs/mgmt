**You have 30 minutes for this agenda**, 5 minutes before the meeting ends, consider moving the remaining items to a github discussion thread so that all the other sprint meetings can start in time.

## Notes

* 0.4.3-rc4 - all PR merged - Juan's review applied
  * fixed bitswap issue with wantlists
  * 0.4.3-rc4 is running on gateways and runs great
* go-ipfs + js-ipfs interop
  * js crypto is problematic but progress on secio is being made
* code coverage milestone got pushed back
* IPLD integration
  * go-cid written
  * integrating go-ipfs with cidv0
    This means that in future when we will be introducing IPLD we just start using cidv1
