  - last week we said we wanna go over "in progress" each week
  - this week we talked about "in progress" vs. "backlog"
    - "in progress" is stuff that's ready to be picked up AND relevant to our milestones
    - "backlog" is stuff that's ready to be picked up AND NOT relevant to our milestones, but still PRs appreciated
