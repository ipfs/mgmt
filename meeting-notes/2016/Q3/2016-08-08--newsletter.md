# Newsletter

Lead: @Richardlitt
Notes: @lgierth

# Agenda

- we haven't sent out a newsletter in like half a year
- @richarlitt has compiled a new newsletter issue
  - asked people for items
  - went through @ipfsbot's retweets
- @jbenet expressed that the newsletter didn't capture everything newsworthy
  - e.g. papers published about ipfs
  - we're subscribed to some social media tool which could help with capturing this
- trying to avoid making things up about newsworthy items just to fill space
- avoid long iterations on the newsletters
  - the current one has gone back and forth as much as 4 times with people
  - get @jbenet in the loop earlier
- single sentence entries are totally okay
- Aggressively collect going forward

## Actionables

- [x] @jbenet: Give @RichardLitt access to the historic log program
- [ ] @RichardLitt: Go through the twitter logs again, making bullet points if necessary
    - Here, and elsewhere, err on the side of more content than less. It is OK to have long newsletters.
    - Add in the TBL article
    - Add in the IPFS paper
- [ ] @RichardLitt Build an action plan for the missing months of content. This still needs to be covered, in some way. Splitting things into multiple newsletters is fine, if they are too long. 
- [ ] @RichardLitt For the next newsletter, build a bullet point list first, and then ping @jbenet about it, to cut down on return time in review
