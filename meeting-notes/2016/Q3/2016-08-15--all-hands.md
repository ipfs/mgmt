## Notes

Author: @dignifiedquire

1. Roll call in timezone order (from east to west)
2. Call 
  - added some more items (5-7)
3. Check in about new call format (@flymingzumwalt)
  - Hopefully on time this week (target is 30min)
  - Each week sprint issue is posted by Wednesday
    - Add items to that issue if you want them to be talked about
  - go-ipfs was moved up, due to @whyrusleeping flying later today (@richardlitt)
    - probably stays that way to make life easier for @whyrusleeping
4. Distributed Meetings (@flyingzumwalt)
  - Calling attention to [Issue #143](https://github.com/ipfs/pm/issues/143 
  - This is about how to do distributed meetings, if possible
  - It would be nice to have a test bed (@jbenet)
  - Failure is usually similar (@diasdavid)
    - Not fully distributed: part of the team is actually not distributed (issues with people being in the same room)
    - Agendas: hard to understand for the people remote to keep up with changes
    - Goal: everyone should work and have access in the same way (ref to a blog post)
  - Is a meeting the right format to generate the output (roadmap for the next quarter)? (@haad)
  - TODO: move the question above to the PM discussion (@flyingzumwalt)
  - Ensure everybody gives input on this issue (@flyingzumwalt)
5. Breakout http-api-spec ? 
  - Issues due to missing automated http-api-spec in development of apis (@diasdavid)
  - Goal: agree on how to move forward (@diasdavid)
  - One of the main issues is that there is no way to notify users that there were changes (@diasdavid)
  - 15min talk today? 
  - thumbs up 
  - happening after libp2p (added to the schedule)
6. Breakout or quick talk about PM (@haadcode) 
  - Close to nailing the model (@haadcode)
  - Thank you to everyone who helped (@haadcode)
  - Goal for talk: How to move the ownership of the document to the "PM group" (@flyingzumwalt, @em-ly) (@haadcode)
  - @haadcode, @em-ly and @flyingzumwalt will schedule something for tomorrow
7. Standard-readme (@richardlitt)
  - Why discussions are moved to the standard-readme repo. 
  - Q: How close is standard-readme to being stable? (@diasdavid)
  - A: It won't be stable ever, but the only thing missing for 1.0 is a linter (@richardlitt)
8.   How will api semver advance? (@ckwaldon1)
  - This will be talked about at the http-api-spec call later today (@jbenet)
9.  Final thoughts ? (@flyingzumwalt)
  - Dependency graphs (@jbenet)
    - Description https://github.com/jbenet/random-ideas/issues/37
    - @noffle has a module that does parsing https://github.com/noffle/github-dependency-crawl
    - @jbenet has a renderer in graphviz
    - Next steps: generating a site/module & getting it ready for consumption
  - CI (@diasdavid)
    - Circle & travis are used usually
    - Travis queue is being used accross an organization
    - One morning of just waiting for CI sometimes 
    - Possible solution: Teamcity, but not fully ready
    - Teamcity would need a list of fast & ready machines to be used for all of this
    - Start a discussion around this (@jbenet)
     - Kickoff hangout, or async? 
    - Drop all thoughts into an issue and have a call on Wednesday (@diasdavid)
    - TODO: @diasdavid create this issues at ipfs/community
 9 . Moderator/notetaker for next time:
  * Moderator: @flyingzumwalt (doing this a couple times for now)
  * Notetaker: @diasdavid with assist
