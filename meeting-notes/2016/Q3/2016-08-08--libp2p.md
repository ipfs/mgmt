## Agenda



## Notes
 - CRDTs / consensus inside libp2p - just beginning the conversation
 - Pubsub has similar interest in this topic
 - Discussions during IPFS workshop:
     - people are super excited
 - Connection closing on go-ipfs is still WIP (@whyrusleeping mia for this call)
 - still hogs your bandwidth
 - Milestones for libp2p
 - Routing (after routing in js-ipfs) WIP)
 - Roadmap is located in the repo
 - Waffle.io board is green, still being developed. https://waffle.io/libp2p/libp2p
 - Roadmap built based off needs in js-ipfs
 - Creating milestones not based off those needs, but rather appropriate well mapped out

 - Having libp2p ready to serve all the needs of IPFS will put the project and it's documentation in a good place to support other projects on IPFS

- Documentation highly neglected, prevents users from being able to build things off of libp2p
 - Having good documentation will help bring more people on board to contribute to the project. 
 - The repo exists, and it's a known need, but nothing has been done.
 - There's a need to have a central documentation hub
- Documentation for devs exist https://github.com/libp2p?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=interface with regards to interfaces of the submodules

Possible solution frame:
    - Tutorials on people who want to do real stuff with the code
    - To help people who want to jump in and start using the code immediately

## Action Items
 - The majority of the work that is going to be happening is already built in as an extension of
