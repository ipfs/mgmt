## Notes

ROADMAP SUPER SPEED ROUND

1st Milestore - filestore

> tl;dr; Avoid moving files into the ipfs-repo, saving a lot of space

- Kevina is doing a lot of work on that
- Shipping on Q4

- IPLD Formats
  - Raw block
  - cbor impl
  - pb
  - (in progress) - bitcoin

- NEW SUBCOMMAND - `dag`

3rd Milestone - Unixfs Sharding

- Enable 'large' dirs to exist in IPFS and be transferable
- Enabled thanks to HAMT
- Blocked by technical review - if you are an expert in Merkle Data Structs and make things fast and memory efficient, please help Jeromy by reviewing the PR?

4th Milestone - Core API

- Lars is the Captain. Aye Mate!
- It makes go-ipfs-api (http client library) and go-ipfs programmatic API match and follow a standard

5th Milestone - Don't kill routers

- "IPFS is a social butterfly" by @why
- And IPFS kills routers (could this be related with the Butterfly effect?)
- IPFS doesn't 'kill' the router (as in: brick them) , what it does is really make them do weird behaviour by abusing its NAT traversal features

6th Milestone - go-ipfs 0.4.4 release

- Lot's of performance improvements
- DHT is less chatty (by a lot!)
- "a bunch of cool features"

7th Milestone - reduce resource consuption

> make IPFS use less bandwith and memory

- goal is to make IPFS run on a tiny machine

8th Milestone - Improve performance! 

> zummmmmmmm

- goal: improve significantly the time it takes to add 10 THOUSAND files
- goal: improve significantly the time it takes to transfer a file with 10Gb over LAN

9th Milestone - Improve Developer Experience

- Documentation
- Tutorials
- Excellent for new contributors! Reach out to @whyrusleeping
