## Notes

### Ensure JSDoc are up-to-date on release
- Some projects more important than others
- Owners of projects make sure projects docs are updated
- We could automatically infer some checks before publishes
- We could make sure everything is updated when doing a PR as well
- Action: to create issue to discuss further in ipfs/js-ipfs

### Benchmarks
- PR is growing old (:insert_link_to_pr_here)
- Main idea: Benchmark the JS implementation of IPFS
- Blocked by issue about uint64 and large numbers (:another_link_plz)
- Important resolver is missing as well
    - Probably can make use of IPLD Resolver

### WAFFLE TIME!
