## Notes

- Apps on IPFS
    - Take a look at the issue
    - @haadcode: Would love to see other people talking on this call
- [Dapphack](https://www.eventbrite.de/e/dapphack-registration-29070767448?aff=eac2)
    - Distributed app hackathon
    - In Berlin, focused mostly on Ethereum and IPFS, based on ether.camp, but became it's own event
    - IPFS was invited to participate, will be running an intro to IPFS (go-, js- , orbit and hacking) workshop
    - Free! If you are in Berlin, **come say hi!**
    - Ethereum devs will be there, BigchainDB, and so on. 
    - Can make an intro to IPFS and get people excited about it, would be great to make a thing to install from the dist. page
    - Would be great to bring some hardware, as the internet will probably not be that great
    - Plan: get people to install js-ipfs, run it on the browser
    - Best moment of the pseudo-workshop to get people to haack on Orbit.
        > "Explaining the dark magic that happens to make the distributed chat app work."
    - "Ok cool" - @lgierth
    - Anyone working on pubsub, would be highly appreciated it we could prioritize it so that we could get it working by the hackathon
- CCC
    - Seems unlikely that we'll get the tickets
    - Really frustrating this year
    - There is going to be a secondary market, so if people really want to go, there will be tickets, but it's not clear what or how
    - "May be best to stay at home with a blanket and tea and watch the livestreams." - @lgierth
- [go-libp2p-raft](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-raft)
    - @hsanjuan basically finished it, the consensus interface that @jbenet and @whyrusleeping designed
    - Need to test it on a real cluster with real computers
    - Will work on ipfs-cluster now
    - Wants to discuss this more in depth in the libp2p call on Wednesday
    - go-libp2p-raft needs a code review! There are some things that more experienced go devs can pick out.
    - [ipfs/ipfs-cluster](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-cluster)
- @jbenet reviews things
    - There are a number of things that need his review
    - He's going to apportion time this week, wanted to create an explicit channel for asking for feedback
    - Please add stuff above or here! (Or in the github sprint issue after this call)
- [depviz](https://github.com/jbenet/depviz)
    - Really hard to figure out what is ready, would be great to have a tool that shows you what is blocking other people
    - Drafted up a specification and possible UX for this tool
    - I want waffle.io + graphviz
    - The idea is to have traditional cards
    - Would be super useful if you wanted to couple it with things like personal dependencies; what you can work on, how you are blocking others
    - I specc'ed it out, and made a bunch of issues
    - Probably 10 hours of work from people who understand d3, waffle, and GitHub
    - Not that much time for a huge amount of impact
    - Requests for help! This would be awesome.
- Demo: Super awesome!

## Actionable Items

- [ ] @diasdavid make an issue in ipfs/community sharing this information
    - List concrete tasks about what we can do when it comes to schedule and preparation (routers!)
