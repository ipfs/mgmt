## Notes

### DEVCON2
 - Lots of great stuff happened, now playing catch up.

### IPLD
 - https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-ipld/pull/60
 - Figured out the API for these things. You have to understand the steps that were taken to reach these results.

### @dignifiedquire review "while you were away..."

 - interop: not fully there yet, due to a small error in bitswap. https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-bitswap/pull/39
 - We have to improve our testing, getting more hands on testing the things that we are building (applies to all products).

### Roadmap Review

 - Milestone 1: mostly completed except for Secio
 - Milestone 2: Almost done with API tasks, still need to improve testing.
 - Milestone 3: Task's aren't available! We knew we wanted to move to IPLD but no one knew how to do that. We have a PR now to start, link here:  https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-ipld/pull/60
 - Milestone 4: We said we weren't going to do Milestone 4 this quarter, but Crypto has been almost completed this month. Still a WIP.
 
 - side note on extra tasks: these things were
