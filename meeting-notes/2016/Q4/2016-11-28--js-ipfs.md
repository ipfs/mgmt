## Agenda

- Status of: Awesome API Documentation (@dignifiedquire) - https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/615
- Status of: Floodsub (@haadcode) - https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/580
- Status of: Improving Init (@haadcode) - https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/556, commit here, PR coming this week https://github.com/haadcode/js-ipfs-api/commit/0757cdb9e95b5810f9f284858ffce7a38ed80637 (only works with go-ipfs v.0.4.5-pre1, or with @haad/go-ipfs-dep module, see next item).
- Improving go-ipfs-dep (@haadcode), not strictly js-ipfs but js nevertheless: Been adding some simple features to go-ipfs-dep so that the downloaded version, platform and architecture can be defined in/for go-ipfs-dep. PR coming soon, code here https://github.com/haadcode/go-ipfs-dep.
- fast-cbor@1.0 was released, coming to js-ipfs soon (@dignifiedquire)
- New Contributors!
    - Do you want to join and contribute to the codebase? Check all the issues in the `ready` with Help Wanted, ask @diasdavid if you need any help
- Waffle time:
    - Pick issues to work on, only put in `in progress` what you are working on
    - Call to action: Use waffle to manage your development, keep it up to date as your focus changes, update depending threads. 
 
**You have 30 minutes for this agenda**, 5 minutes before the meeting ends, consider moving the remaining items to a github discussion thread so that all the other sprint meetings can start in time.

## Notes
- Status of: Awesome API Documentation (@dignifiedquire) - https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/615
@dignifiedquire is always prepared! demo'd

Next goal: to make automated on Travis (?)
@dignifiedquire has started to work on Peerid
@victorbjelkholm has volunteered to take down js-ipfs and js-ipfs-api

- Status of: Floodsub (@haadcode) - https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/580
@haad left notes on this for the call. There is a pull request for both that has floodsub implementations. Please review, we probably need more tests. But we should have standardized floodsub on both js-ipfs and js-ipfs-api.

 - Status of: Improving Init (@haadcode) - https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/556, commit here, PR coming this week https://github.com/haadcode/js-ipfs-api/commit/0757cdb9e95b5810f9f284858ffce7a38ed80637 (only works with go-ipfs v.0.4.5-pre1, or with @haad/go-ipfs-dep module, see next item).

Improves the experience in spawning deamons because right now it's very messy and not very well documented. 

- Improving go-ipfs-dep (@haadcode), not strictly js-ipfs but js nevertheless: Been adding some simple features to go-ipfs-dep so that the downloaded version, platform and architecture can be defined in/for go-ipfs-dep. PR coming soon, code here https://github.com/haadcode/go-ipfs-dep.

No new notes.

- fast-cbor@1.0 was released, coming to js-ipfs soon (@dignifiedquire)

fast-cbor is fast. Coming soon: js-ipld-cbor(?!)

- Waffle time: waffle.io/ipfs/js-ipfs
* As mentioned last week, We should use Waffle.io as our progress tracking tool. This is where future contributors learn about the project. "In Progress" only contains things that are actively being worked on.
