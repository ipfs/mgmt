## Notes

- apiary status
  - no good news :) things are messy, between js-ipfs and go-ipfs
  - apiary can't describe the semantics of a few of our endpoints
  - mostly because ipfs api is RPC, and apiary is REST-focused
  - ipfs api is RPC on purpose
  - we must not break the existing apis
  - we need to document current version, no matter if it brings new benefits, that we can use for testing
  - follow up here: https://github.com/ipfs/http-api-spec/issues/122
  - js-ipfs and go-ipfs have subtle and so subtle differences, same for apiary
  - we need a single source of truth
  - core-api is supposed to be/become source of truth
  - while single components aren't finished yet, go-ipfs is the source of truth for that
  - important note: core api isn't equivalent to the http api, it's a subset of it
- pm
  - eventually we wanna use @haadcode's roadmap-generator
  - in order to do that we need to codify the labels and milestones
    - @haadcode's labels-and-milestones tool
  - roadmap-generator can just run within any repo
  - while labels-and-milestones is a bit rough around the edges
    - needs both ruby and js
    - seems to need a separate housekeeping repo
    - @flyingzumwalt will get support from @haadcode
  - in Q3 js-ipfs used waffle milestones-as-columns
  - in Q4 we're starting to use workflow-states-as-columns
  - having the rendered roadmaps in the respective git repos yields cool advantages
    - history, diffs, etc.
  - idea: central repo for all labels-and-milestones configs
    - ci hook for rendering the new roadmaps after changes
- needs-review label
  - pleeease remove the needs-review when you've reviewed
  - sometimes when someone has reviewed something, it's not clear to them if someone else should review too
    - assign them
  - some repos have a captain that must sign-off (e.g. go-ipfs)
  - tl;dr please remove the needs-review label when it's not needed anymore
  - New Issue: https://github.com/ipfs/pm/issues/238 
    - Clarify conventions about when it's ok to Merge a PR and when to remove "needs review" #238
- multiformats captain
  - @lgierth offers to be captain
  - will follow up with a GH issue
  - isn't @richardlitt the captain? let's discuss on GH
  - https://github.com/multiformats/multiformats/issues/29
- orbit call
  - next week
  - we might need to make space in the schedule
  - let's discuss in the sprint issue for next week
- ipld call
  - bump it off mondays?
  - @richardlitt gonna talk to @nicola about it
- demos
  - iiif on ipfs
