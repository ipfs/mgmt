### Sync in Waffle

Other than website, there are no particular priorities for this week.
There is some overlap with priorities in other projects, like async-crypto endeavor.
Lots of issues are "In Progress". Most of them were covered in the go-ipfs call.
@diasdavid says Let's give some love to the libp2p waffle board. Especially some go-libp2p issues need to be cleaned up by @whyrusleeping
