## Notes

- go-libp2p breakage
    - it should be fixed by now
    - we don't make any guarantees about go-get'ed packages
    - gx all the things
    - move all packages into shared accounts
    - TODO @lgierth has a list of repos that need to be moved
- consensus interface
    - oplog assumes you can apply generic operations to a state
    - impractical, you'll end up sending the state itself
    - @whyrusleeping: you need to model your system and data structures in a certain fashion that fits
    - continue here: https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-consensus/pull/3
- simplify js-libp2p installation
    - crypto packages require openssl bindings
    - doesn't work on windows
    - one idea is to have prebuilt packages, but no idea yet how to make this secure
    - needs contributors
- pubsub
    - omitting this because gavin and haad are both not present
- milestones
    - documentation: @dignifiedquire working on it
        - using jsdoc, looking pretty good
    - libp2p github org
        - no update, @richard isn't prese
    - libp2p.io
        - tasks written down
        - not much else yet
- private networks
    - please review! :)
    - https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-pnet
    - write up: https://gist.github.com/Kubuxu/b96b64be00ef949c8d486fe6e6bfc43e
    - should there be a spec?
        - @daviddias: there are ideas for more sophisticated schemes
        - @lgierth: it's one way to do private networking, the other ideas are more ways
        - @kubuxu: compare it wifi, psk is good enough for 90% of the cases, enterprise mode is more complicated
        - @whyrusleeping: psk pnet leaks very few information, the more sophisticated mechanisms leak more info
        - @daviddias: yep that all makes sense
    - probably need to specify that you can't e.g. use public TURN/STUN servers
        - @Kubuxu: yes of course, you're building your own private network, that means having signaling servers, bootstrap nodes, etc.
- waffle time
    - yes

##### After sprint meeting is finished, create the respective action items on the Github sprint issue
