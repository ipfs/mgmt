    - @johnnycrunch:
        > has beenn exploring JSON-LD for self-sovereign digital identity solutions, but lately have been contemplating IPLD as the '@context' link would need to be a persistent URL ( perfect application for IPFS). in JSON-LD the '@context' attribute aids in semantic interoperability of the data. The same could be done in IPLD and I'd love to explore this concept. The issue with JSON-LD using IPFS for the context is the JSON content for the '@context' needs to be deterministic
