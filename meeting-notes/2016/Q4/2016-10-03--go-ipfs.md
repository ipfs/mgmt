## Agenda


**You have 30 minutes for this agenda**, 5 minutes before the meeting ends, consider moving the remaining items to a github discussion thread so that all the other sprint meetings can start in time.

## Notes

Q3 Milestones:
- https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/milestones
- https://waffle.io/ipfs/go-ipfs
- biggest milestone: IPLD
  - didn't get as far as we hoped
  - implemented CID and partially integrated into go-ipfs
  - solid idea of what the interfaces are gonna look like
  - integration path is clear
  - todo: make those changes (@whyrusleeping is doing it right now, hopefully done by 10-Oct)
- js-ipfs/go-ipfs interop
  - works! yes we did.
  - made it work just to get pubsub -- that was a great motivator to finally get it done
- release go-ipfs 0.4.3
  - actually wanted to release that beginning of Q3
  - refined a lot, couple of release candidates
  - it's way better than 0.4.2
- release go-ipfs 0.4.4
  - not going to happen in Q3
- pubsub
  - simple basic implementation which works
  - it's in go-ipfs master, run daemon with --enable-pubsub-experiment
  - need to connect nodes which have pubsub enabled
  - hasn't been heavily tested yet
- resource constraints
  - basic idea: improve how much cpu/memory/bandwidth go-ipfs consumes
  - go-ipfs 0.4.3 is a lot more well-behaved than 0.4.2
  - 0.4.4 gonna be even better
  - memory usage still has much room for improvement, so that go-ipfs can run e.g. on embedded devices
- 100 % test coverage
  - made good progress, but only got roughly two thirds through all our go repos
  - great way to get started contributing
  - likely not going to get compleled in Q3
- core api
  - actual milestone was initially to extract the http-to-ipfs gateway into a standalone lib and tool
  - gateway extraction gonna get finished on time
  - core api implementation coverage very spotty
  - go-ipfs-api package not touched yet
  
stuff for Q4
- cleanup
- IPLD
- cleanup
- improve code quality & test coverage
- cleanup
- maybe private networks (cc @flyingzumwalt for capturing the use cases)
- and the hangover from Q4


##### After sprint meeting is finished, create the respective action items on the Github sprint issue
