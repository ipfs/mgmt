## Agenda

- Make dag-pb an immutable class https://github.com/ipld/js-ipld-dag-pb/issues/4
- We need to double down our efforts in figuring out: https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-api/issues/339

## Notes

### Waffle Board
There's a lot of noise in the "done" column from greenkeeper
@flyingzumwalt looks like waffle does not (yet) support filtering out issues by label. See https://github.com/waffleio/waffle.io/issues/1045
People have been voting up the feature since June 2014 :(

#### Async Crypo PR Mountain

- most are merged
- just some small fixes left
- multistream-select got matching functions in order to handle the new bitswap protocol
- js-ipfs-api bug with wreck + browserify currently (@dignifiedquire) hopefully a fix will come this week, which will drop wreck in favor of a simpler solution

- TODO: raise issue about filtering out greenkeeper PRs from waffle 

##### In Progress

- bitswap + async crypto + bundeling is the focus this week
- TODO: raise some feedback with greenkeeper

##### Inbox 

- 0, yeah @diasdavid

##### Ready

- DAG Api, needs feedback and discussion to finalize, please go to https://github.com/ipfs/interface-ipfs-core/issues/81
- IPLD resolver patch
- Implement datastore for js-ipfs. Compatible with go-ipfs. Ready to be worked on. Please reach out if you want to do this
- 
- Mediachain is investgating making cbor compilation faster (or at least they were)
- Ensure that cbor objects always result in the same binary representation.  Moved to "In Progress"
-Fix CI on Node@7 stable. Waiting for hapi.js release
- TODO: File tracking issue for `Buffer()` usage

#### Other

- Make dag-pb an immutable function

- TODO: go to the issue and discuss the exact api


// sorry for the bad notes....

#### Floodsub

- Canceling subscriptions on socket disconnects is a weird pattern
  - fetch requests are not cancelable
  - js-ipfs has no sockets open when it performs a .subscirbe
- Gavin will tackle a first iteratin of the floodsub API
