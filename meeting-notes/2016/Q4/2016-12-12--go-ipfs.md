## Notes

0.4.5 release
- automatic gc, and gc timestamps
    - gc tests have timing issues
    - @lgierth will try and figure something out, otherwise they'll stay disabled a little longer
- go-multihash blake2 (@Kubuxu)
    - finishing multihash code allocation
    - maybe updating go-crypto lib
    - @whyrusleeping: please also cover double sha2-256
- core api refinements
    - implicit vs. explicit path/cid parsing
    - path interface
    - let's nail the discussion today
    - https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/3490
- coreunix.add pinning docs
    - says it's pinning stuff which it isn't
    - @lgierth updating these docs
    - [ ] @lgierth also discovered potential issues with add locking, will open issue and address after 0.4.5
- filefs prefix fanout vs. cid
    - cid prefixes make stuffs all end up in the same directory, which is less than ideal
    - @kevina waiting for review/feedback
    - maybe use few-char suffixes instead of prefixes
    - remark @daviddias
        - this is an fs-repo change affecting other ipfs impls, we need a better process around these changes
        - @jbenet: fs-repo is a protocol! need to update the protocol spec and follow the respective procedures for spec changes
        - https://github.com/ipfs/specs/tree/master/repo <--- part of the protocol for 2 years now. this spec is horribly outdated.
        - [ ] @lgierth will carry this discussion to a github issue
- changelog
    - in progress
- propagate ds-metrics changes
    - @Kubuxu in progress
- daemon confusing error messages
    - @lgierth or @whyrusleeping taking care of it
- @jbenet's 0.4.3 feedback
    - make sure all of it has been addressed
- 80% test coverage across packages
    - we're getting there, but not reaching 80% in this release
- release procedure
    - release branch starting at rc1, and not merging back
    - [ ] @lgierth gonna carry discussion to github

go-ipfs-api
- frustration about slow feedback cycles, would like to meet people more
- @lgierth/@keks gonna meet :)

link size overflow
- in go-ipfs everything seems to work, just `ipfs object stat` overflows
- in js-ipfs things blow up
- maybe protobuf has a varint type
    - yes go-protobuf parses it in a weird way
- @Kubuxu it's very tricky
- continue here https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/3440
