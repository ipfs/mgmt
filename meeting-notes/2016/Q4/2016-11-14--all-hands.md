     - Ref: http://doodle.com/poll/659qpabx6vce3kfp#table

### Hackpad
     - First time using a new note taking method (normally etherpad)
     - Leave feedback on the conversation on GitHub: https://github.com/ipfs/community/issues/196
     - Does anyone know the developers of Hackpad?
         - Let's get it running on IPFS \o/

### Discourse (https://github.com/ipfs/community/issues/190)
 - We're currently in a trial phase, @RichardLitt is monitoring success of transition, lots of conversation going on Discourse about discourse - it's important to see the community involved here.
       
 - Important conversations on Discourse:
http://ipfs.trydiscourse.com/t/how-do-we-know-if-discourse-is-right-for-us-and-how-long-time-will-it-take-to-figure-out/24

- David suggesting something like "Help the community"-day where we can sit together and answer questions
    - Important that we focus on building up our text base of information.

- Important to know about UX for Discourse vs GitHub
    - GitHub defaults to notifications about every activity
    - You wont get the same experience from Discourse, which means you have to be more proactive with engaging with the content, or turn the notifications on.
    - Lars experimented with turning on notifications but still has not received notifications since then.

### Related to FAQ: 
"Top Topics that Need Better Documentation"
https://github.com/ipfs/community/issues/199 

 - Please review to see what topics are being raised, and continue to add to the list so that we can identify what people are asking the most about and build out those resources.

### CCC
 - When is the next call for tickets?
     - Saturday UTC 

 - Is there a way to automate this? Can we script it?
     - Is this how the robot revolution starts?
