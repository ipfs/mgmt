(sorry I forgot to capture these)

## Agenda

- Take a look at what has happened in Orbit and orbit-db in the last few weeks
- Discuss the initial ideas for goals for Q4

**You have 30 minutes for this agenda**, 5 minutes before the meeting ends, consider moving the remaining items to a github discussion thread so that all the other sprint meetings can start in time.

## Notes

- long time no talking about apps on ipfs!

q3 goals:
- done: fix and clean up orbit after making it run on js-ipfs for decentralized web submmit
- nearly done: integrate orbit and uport, presented at devcon2
  - not in master yet
  - video of devcon2 presentation will be published some time soon
- in progress: developer experience
  - refactoring
  - improving documentation
  - creating issues for everything
  - more work on this this week
- done: pubsub
  - actually done! :)
  - not in orbit master yet
  - pubsub will be in go-ipfs 0.4.4
  - no more servers for pubsub
    - obviously still need bootstrap servers

in progress:
- working on an indexed document store type for orbit-db
  - similar to couchdb's map-function based views
  - indexed by a certain field, can the be queried based on that, e.g. get documents by title
  - orbit as a pouchdb backend: https://github.com/haadcode/orbit-db/issues/4

question:
- what about the irc/orbit bridge
  - there's a prototype which imports irc messages into an orbit channel
  - yes yes we're definitely gonna get to it soon
  - it's non-trivial

next:
- orbit has been a prototype for seeing how we wanna do certain things on ipfs
- we wanna make it a real thing/product now
  - easy installtion, etc.
- dogfeed it, make it work for a medium-sized team
  - very useful: bots, it should be really easy to write and deploy bots
    - https://github.com/haadcode/orbit/blob/bot/src/bot/index.js
- hubot integration
- pinning/caching for messages and channels
- test network


##### After sprint meeting is finished, create the respective action items on the Github sprint issue
