- New Contributors!
    - Do you want to join and contribute to the codebase? Check all the issues in the `ready` with Help Wanted, ask @diasdavid if you need any help

**You have 30 minutes for this agenda**, 5 minutes before the meeting ends, consider moving the remaining items to a github discussion thread so that all the other sprint meetings can start in time.

## Notes

- webrtc bootstrapper
  - @daviddias gonna address @lgierth's feedback
  - then get it deployed to something like bootstrap.libp2p.io
- crypto
  - our problem: native dependencies, since nodejs doesn't ship everything we need for interop with go-ipfs
  - major thing missing: rsa key generation, so we need openssl bindings
  - cat cameo
  - rsa key generation is important enough to be in nodejs core, dignifiedquire probably wants to make PR, won't land before nodejs 8 though
  - suggestions: try to use native dependencies, if that fails fall back to pure js version
  - openssl native installation works on linux/osx/windows, except for when node-gyp isn't set up correctly
  - or: let's just wait for go-ipfs switch to ed25519 keys, which are much much much faster to generate and everything is candycones and unicorns
  - sha3: optional native dependency, otherwise pure js version (it's not used much at the moment anyhow)
  - prebuilt binaries -- how would we verify these?
- GH issue labels
  - @kubuxu: libp2p-backlog label doesn't work for go's waffle board
  - @whyrusleeping: i'm fine having duplicate labels, it let's us e.g. have an issue in ready for go side and backlog for js side

##### After sprint meeting is finished, create the respective action items on the Github sprint issue
