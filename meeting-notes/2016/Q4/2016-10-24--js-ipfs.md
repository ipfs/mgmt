## Notes

- milestones
  - interplanetary js
    - developer ux
    - transpilation, which runtime versions to support, etc.
    - Q: some of these shouldn't wait for end-of-Q4 to be decided, to avoid friction with users/developers
    - A: if we find a consensus for an issue earlier, we should of course settle it. here we're timeboxing all these UX issues to be settled by end-of-Q3
  - interface-floodsub
  - ipld
    - pretty close to shipping (on the js side)
  - async crypto
    - motivated by bundle size caused by big crypto library, and their performance
    - some browsers don't support the webcrypto primitives we need :(
    - this highlights the importance of settling the question of which runtimes to support (see developer ux milestone)
    - no webcrypto polyfill that fits our needs
      - we'd have to write it ourselves
  - bitswap
    - goal: fetching unixfs files and directories from go-ipfs

##### After sprint meeting is finished, create the respective action items on the Github sprint issue
