## Notes

Going through milestones

Missed the first one (floodsub-interface) because everyone was away and/or sick, David and Juan working on it, need collaboration

Awesome-IPLD

    Lot of things have been ready, missing some last pr's in js-ipfs

    Not including the dag-api

    There is an existing proposal for dag-api in interface-ipfs-core

    We need code review from any JS folks! https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/532

    This will get merged once there is a review


Async Crypto (really more than just crypto)

    Lots of stuff missing

    https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/485

    Making crypto faster and browser builds smaller

    Upgrading aegir < Depending on decision on transpiling

    lots of things have to be updated because of an update to aegir 9

    btrfs seems not to be good with browsers and/or CI's, js-ipfs-api currently broken because of this


Going through waffle


## Actions

* [ ]  Friedel and David to make sure Bitswap is proper (??)

##### After sprint meeting is finished, create the respective action items on the Github sprint issue
