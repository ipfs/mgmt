## Notes

### Milestones & Waffleboard
- Dag API should accept paths, but should https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/3500
- Core API, what kind of arguments should it accept? https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/3490
- Default 5 digit prefix for flatfs is no longer... https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/3463
    - Might require repo migration
    - Maybe not, cid version gives us required info
    - CID is in file name in the repo
        - that is news to a lot of people
    - Repo migrations should be batched if possible to reduce amount of migrations
    - Further discussion in https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/3463
- We want 80% code coverage on all code https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/3053 
    - Slowly moving forward
- Issue with garbage collection https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/3454

### Rework `commands.Response` API
https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/3524

Please take a look and comment! I can start in January.


### Review Makefile review
https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/3504

Make Makefile infrastructure non-recursive. Allows for nicer submodularization. Also it reduces redundant operations during the tests. Makes the Makefile a little bit more complex though.

@lgierth will take a look.

### Pubsub marshalling & pb update in floodsub implementation
https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/3522

pubsub currently defines the target as string but we put binary multihash inside 

- string type should only be valid ascii/utf-8
- should be `bytes`/`[]byte`
- in js-bitswap a type was moved from bytes to string.
- in go world `string` â‰ˆ `[]byte`, but not in json world
- further discussion in the issue

<!-- After each call, it is the responsibility of the notetaker to save the last
