## Notes

milestones:

- interfaces
    - discussion and revisiting didn't happen
- xtp interface
    - that got discussed, and is at a stage where it could be implemented
    - remaining problems: finding names that don't carry much weight yet
- docs
    - js-libp2p docs tooling is in place
    - ask @dignifiedquire if you need help
    - some js-libp2p modules already have pending docs PRs
    - @diasdavid saying the "interfaces" milestone will yield more documentation
    - @dignifiedquire saying, yes, but everybody's actively using this stuff *now*
- standardize libp2p org
    - @richardlitt and @diasdavid made and merged a lot of PRs for that
    - probably done, but @richardlitt isn't here
    - Q: should equivalent js/go modules should have the same name? e.g. go-tcp-transport/js-libp2p-tcp
        - A: depends on "interfaces" milestone
- libp2p.io
    - first 3 of the 6 tasks in this milestone are done
    - https://github.com/libp2p/website
- private networks
    - @jbenet's concern: current scheme could enable transparent bridges
    - but it's good to ship for now
    - spec and docs are written just need to commit
    - will iterate
- packet switching
    - there's a PR for PacketConn support in go-multiaddr-net
- relay
    - no progress

other stuff

- we have specs for /dns and /tls in multiaddrs
    - /dns: https://github.com/multiformats/multiaddr/issues/22
    - /tls: will be posted in multiformats/multiaddr too
- gavin: working on realtime messaging between nodes in an overlay on top of ipfs
- default bootstrappers have /ip6 now


<!-- After each call, it is the responsibility of the notetaker to save the last
version of the notes in a file in ipfs/pm/meeting-notes, by opening a branch and
