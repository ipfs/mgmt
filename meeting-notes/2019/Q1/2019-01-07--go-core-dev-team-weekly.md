## Notes

### Week Update

@marten-seemann:
  - Done: 
    - proposed a better mechanism for transport key updates in QUIC
    - found a DoS vulnerability in the current QUIC specification and proposed a solution
    - started interop testing with other draft-17 QUIC implementations. Still *a lot* of work to do, but this already proved hugely benefitial in finding issues

  - Blocked: ---
  - Next: focussing on interop testing for now

    - Make CoreAPI tests not crash with go-ipfs-http-api - https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/5900 **(Needs Review)**
 - Blocked:
   - Mumble server setup waiting for infra response - https://github.com/protocol/ad-hoc-infra/pull/6
   - (Decision needed) - Do we relaly need go/js core interfaces to live next to each other  https://github.com/ipfs/interface-ipfs-core/issues/423
 - Next:
   - Implement all major CoreAPI parts in go-ipfs-http-api
   - Try to ressurect datastore benchmark efforts
   - Setup mumble server (impromptu voice communication) - https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/5837
     - Should I make it publicly accessible or should it have a password / something like that for now?

@warpfork
  - Done:
    - Happy holidays, y'all
    - IPLD: had some good conversations at CCC, got new ideas about open-vs-closed unions/etc; have notes, need to make them accessible to others.
  - Blocked: nah
  - Next:
    - Boil open-vs-closed into a decision tree... um, schema, and document that.
    - Moar go-ipld-prime implementation.  Maybe fleshing out some of the ipldcbor.Node impl?  A lot of things need love.

@djdv
 - Done:
   - Minor documentation things
   - this /ipfs/QmUiDVir9imgCpPLmXgTwLRTpHXrkn4vg2n7grc54MRk1N
   - Large mount refactor, much better performance (https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/5003#issuecomment-449764627)
   - mount now builds and runs on MacOS and Linux (dependencies are not gx'd yet)
 - Next:
   - Continue investigating showstopping elusive bug in mount and third party libraries it depends on (detailed https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/5003#issuecomment-451751681)
   - Get pkg in a state where other people can help review/debug, coupled with a screencast walking through the implementation (sometime after lunch)

@kevina 
  - Done:
    - Rebase `--cid-base=base32` 
    - Work on config options for specifing default CID base
  - Blocked/Asks:
     - `--cid-base` p.r. needs help deciding command line option for upgrading CIDv0 to CIDv1 in order to display the CID in the correct multibase https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/5789, likely to go with `--force-cid-base` 
  - Next:
    - Today: Write status report for go side of CIDv1 base32 (keep forgetting about it, sorry) -- note Eric says no longer needed
    - Hopefully get `--cid-base` p.r. merged
    - Move config options for changing the default base issue along 
    - Start work on chagning the DHT (providers) to use Multihashes instead of CIDs

### Questions

### Other notes

- Gateways are running into issue in bitswap sessions where we don't connect to peers that we find. Issue is here: https://github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap/issues/53. @stebalien thinks this is a critical issue currently impacting gateway performance: https://github.com/protocol/infra/issues/410

- CORS handling is messy and we should investigate and rework. @daviddias knows about CORS and indicates that it's not just our handling of CORS - it's also about how people configure proxies. @eingenito to make a roll-up issue for CORS in go-ipfs and share with @daviddias. 

- 0.4.19 Release. @stebalien is starting to pull together a new release and wonders if people know of outstanding blockers apart from the bitswap session connection issue mentioned above. @daviddias wondered if before we release we could have Openbazzaar test the RC, but @steb indicated that that was a lot of work for the as they have to rebase their changes on ours. Multiple days of work.
