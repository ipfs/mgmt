### Notes

- @andrew
  - It took 12 hours to sync Ubuntu to IPFS
  - need docs to help package manager people get up-to-speed with IPFS
  - @jim: it would be cool to turn importing Ubuntu into a test case
  - @adin: why AFS? @andrew: Needs permissions for sensitive government stuff
  - @david: get list of hard performance requirements - grouped by package manager
            (in visual form)
  - @achingbrain: needs to be faster than http
  - @andrew: documentation needs to be leveled up
  - @david: documentation: drive it by blog posts
