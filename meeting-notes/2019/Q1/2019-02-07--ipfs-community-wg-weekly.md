        -   _A (@mikeal): File tutorial we’re working on will be more helpful for that audience_

-   _@jimpick Thinking about how to build better onboarding for PeerBase. Getting pretty stable but needs better readme and simpler examples / onboarding. Maybe home automation example. Shines on multiple devices for collaboration to show why you’d want to use CRDT. Hard to do a tutorial to show multiple-person interaction. Maybe use a bot to get that?_

    -   _@mikeal Early Dat(?) & WebTorrent had cool early chat demos_

-   _Community hack week next week in SF (Mikeal, Teri, Portia)_

    -   _Debating moving from Vue to VuePress - would affect URLs, googleability, SEO, etc._

  
**Action Items**

_Announce issues that need help, get people to help_
