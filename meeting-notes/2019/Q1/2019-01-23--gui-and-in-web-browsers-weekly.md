@terichadbourne
-   Done:
    -   Explored existing file API resources with @alanshaw in preparation for building a ProtoSchool tutorial. Please weigh in on my tutorial proposal at<https://github.com/ProtoSchool/protoschool.github.io/issues/91> before I get started building!
    -   We noticed that the file exchange demo on the main page of js.ipfs.io is broken because it hasnâ€™t been updated for a recent change where youâ€™re now supposed to just type node.whatever instead of node.files.whatever. I donâ€™t know where the right repo is to log this. Error when I drag and drop a file: `TypeError: node.files.add is not a function at readFileContents.then (pen.js:666:20)`
        -   <https://github.com/ipfs/js.ipfs.io/issues/232> 
    -   Note the issue filed proposing a tutorial about hosting static websites on IPFS (may relate to one of the OKRs here) & feel free to add your thoughts:<https://github.com/ProtoSchool/protoschool.github.io/issues/139> 
    -   Started a #speaking channel in Slack to help PL employees collaborate to build speaking skills. Semimonthly call coming soon with an opportunity to rehearse and get feedback on talks. Join us!

**Discussion Highlights**

_Discussion highlights and additional notes._

-   _What to do about Chromium v3 manifest_
    -   Tracking at <https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/issues/666>
    -   For performance â€¦ make ad blockers use declarative API in manifest for intercepting
    -   30,000 rule limit
    -   We do a lot of extra things in IPFS Companion
    -   We can do a lot of things, but would lose seamless experience
    -   Currently a bit of a backlash, ongoing
    -   Would require rewriting
-   Brave
    -   Before, plan to ship go-ipfs with Brave
    -   Now, embedded js-ipfs in ipfs-companion + Brave exposing [ChromeOS APIs](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/issues/664)
    -   @lidel @alanshaw and @olizilla will have a dedicated call on this
