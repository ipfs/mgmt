    - ProtoSchool (https://proto.school/) is an educational community offering self-guided tutorials on decentralized web protocols including IPFS, as well as local chapter events with mentors available to help you.
    -  Tutorials (https://proto.school/#/tutorials)

        -   Live code challenges with realtime feedback to the user
        -   Progress is saved/cached between learning sessions
        -   Give it a try, first lesson does not require any coding :-)

    - Chapters (https://proto.school/#/chapters)

        -   Local chapters use site as curriculum + provide hands-on support

    - Contribute (https://proto.school/#/contribute)

        -   Improve or add tutorials

            -   Ask: explore website and provide feedback (at the end of page or via [protoschool/issues/new](https://github.com/ProtoSchool/protoschool.github.io/issues/new/choose))

        -   Create a chapter, organize an event: <https://proto.school/#/host>
        -   Spread the word: <https://twitter.com/protoschool>

    -   Q&A:

        -   Q(Victor): Is ProtoSchool supposed to replace the existing IPFS-Meetups we have?[ https://www.meetup.com/topics/ipfs/](https://www.meetup.com/topics/ipfs/) or maybe they are complementary?

            -   A(Teri): complementary :)

        -   Q(Jim): Will it expand to other protocols (eg. DAT)?

            -   A(Mikeal): We eventually want to have wide curriculum with core concepts and may eventually expand to other things, but for now focus is on showing concepts using IPFS/IPLD etc.

        -   Q(Dan): Will all content be generated on the site? Or can we link to external resources?

            -   A(Teri): ProtoSchool tutorials will live on the ProtoSchool website. We want to keep content brief, but linking to more detailed concept descriptions eg. on canonical docs is an option.

            -   A(Mikeal): One reason for hosting all tutorials on ProtoSchool site is that we want to ensure a unified experience that flows naturally.

        -   Q(Don): What about collaboration with other organizations to ensure people are properly educated what IPFS and Filecoin are etc? How to avoid issues about confusion like recent event in Hong Kong?

            -   A(Mikeal): We will follow up that offline.
            -   A(Portia): Emphasize Filecoin is only one of many projects that are built on top of IPFS/IPLD/libp2p. Help by getting that message across, contribute to ProtoSchool, create innovations that use IPFS/IPLD/libp2p etc.

        -   Q(Alan): Is there a place where people can ask questions about tutorials when they get stuck and get answers from experts - like with NodeSchool?

            -   A(Teri): Report issues/suggestions via [protoschool/issues/new](https://github.com/ProtoSchool/protoschool.github.io/issues/new/choose) or link at the bottom of each lesson. Also, if you want to help with addressing feedback, watch repo <https://github.com/ProtoSchool/protoschool.github.io/issues>
            - A(Mikeal): We've kept this function within the main repo for now because most reports of confusion are currently about needing to fix the lesson, not needing to provide personalized support, be we may re-assess as more people submit questions.

        -   Thank you!
