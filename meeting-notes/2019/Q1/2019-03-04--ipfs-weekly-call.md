**Agenda**Presenter: Kevin WongTopic: IPFS Community in ChinaNotes:-   @pkafei: What are people at meetups are most curious about?

    -   People mostly come to the meetups for Filecoin
    -   Attendees are also interested in how IPFS can change the world and replace HTTP and centralized storage solutions

-   @pkafei: Are there any non-Filecoin projects being created in Hong Kong and Mainland China?

    -   A news platform: https://matters.news/forum/

-   @momack2: How big is the interest in IPFS/Filecoin compared to other projects in that space?

    -   Tron a bit (it’s big in the news), but not much else.

-   @NukeManDan: How well does IPFS work in regards to China’s firewall

    -   It is not a problem in Hong Kong because there isn’t a firewall
    -   In China you can’t mine Filecoin at home, it’s blocked

-   @pkafei How do you spot/deal with a Filecoin/IPFS scam?

    -   People report that companies pretend to provide hardware that does Filecoin mining today (this isn’t the case because currently there’s only a Filecoin testnet)
    -   In China there’s more IPFS/Filecoin scammers than in Hong Kong
    -   @kk3wong recommends that Protocol Labs should work with local groups so that know about the Scams

-   How can Protocol Labs find local partners in China?

    -   It’s not easy, you need to check the background of those communities
    -   Many communities are partnering with Filecoin mining machine companies and are not just solely working with IPFS.

-   @terichadbourne: Is there a firewall in Taiwan?

    -   No, Taiwan doesn’t have a firewall.
