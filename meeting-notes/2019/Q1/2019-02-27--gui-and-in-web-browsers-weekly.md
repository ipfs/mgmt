**Discussion Highlights**

_Discussion highlights and additional notes._

-   (Brave) We got hapi v18 inside of WebExtension
    -   Yes, we run HTTP Server inside of HTTP Browser :‚Äô^)
    -   Why its cool? Hapi is the HTTP server used by js-ipfs to expose HTTP Gateway
        -   Embedded js-ipfs does not start when chrome.sockets APIs are enabled yet, but we are getting there
    -   More: <https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/issues/664#issuecomment-467854030>
-   (CI for websites) with pinning sites to cluster, notifying github, and updating dns
    -   For DNSimple API (most of our sites will use this): <https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-dns-deploy> 
    -   Version for Cloudflare API: <https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/dnslink-cloudflare>
    -   ‚ÄúWebsite added to IPFS‚Äù shown as one of checks under a PR on GitHub, with a link to a preview at the public gateway!
    -   PSA: Some websites may have some issues with finding content until we migrate to new CI setup (old version was not pinned to cluster and we shut down the node on Jenkins that acted as the only seed)
-   (ipfs-desktop) auto-update confirmed to work flawlessly on windows, small UX improvement required on OSX (we want to polish this before going public)
-   (ipfs-webui)
    -   Files screen in v2.4.0 will be able to render thousands of items (such as [XKCD archive](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qmb8wsGZNXt5VXZh1pEmYynjB6Euqpq3HYyeAdw2vScTkQ))
    -   Improved Add to IPFS menu
    -   Improved drag & drop (you can drop anywhere on Web UI now, and it will do the right thing!)
-   (ipfs js in browser)
    -   bundle size improvements continue to land!
    -   PSA: [pull-to-stream](https://github.com/hugomrdias/pull-to-stream) - pull-stream to stream module for code paths that require a safe implementation
-   (peer-base) we may see much more cross-team pollination and experimentation around peer-base-based (ha!) collaborations
-   (demo by @andrew) PoC ipfs support in homebrew \\o/
-   (analytics) discussion around self-hosted analytics that landed in v2.4.0
    -   Set up self-hosted service, so users don‚Äôt need to trust a third party, just us
    -   First iteration tried to respect opt-out via DNT header, but it seems to be [dead](https://gizmodo.com/apple-is-removing-do-not-track-from-safari-1832400768) and go-ipfs strongly prefers opt-in approach.
    -   This produced an open question: in what form it is ok to track user activity?  
        Discussion happens at: <https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-webui/issues/980>
-   (help/onboarding) discussed where to look for good examples of unobtrusive help system to onboard new users, continued in <https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-webui/issues/979>
