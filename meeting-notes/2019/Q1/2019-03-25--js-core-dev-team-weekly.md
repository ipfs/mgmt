## Notes

### Week Update


@vmx
 - Done:
   - IPLD Selectors spec is a thing: https://github.com/ipld/specs/blob/4fc79023df9e4bd0eb226c24db12701fca6498ee/selectors/selectors.md
   - Merged NEW JS-IPLD API:
     - https://github.com/ipld/js-ipld/pull/190
     - https://github.com/ipld/js-ipld/pull/191
     - And updated PRs for js-ipfs-unixfs and js-ipfs-mfs
   - Ongoing discussion on the new IPLD Formats API:
     - Too many changes in this version in order to find agreement: https://github.com/ipld/interface-ipld-format/pull/50
     - Hence a new version at https://github.com/ipld/interface-ipld-format/pull/51
     - For the interested ones, there's even discussions about an API change after that API change: https://github.com/ipld/interface-ipld-format/issues/52
  - js-ipfs-block is soon js-ipld-block: https://github.com/ipld/js-ipld-block/pull/46 Please be aware that if you upgrade your library it will also be a breaking change for you as comparing js-ipfs-blocks with js-ipld-blocks would fail (thanks @alanshaw for pointing that out)
 - Blocked:
   - Nope
 - Next:
   - More IPLD Formats spec work
   - Update js-ipfs PR for new JS-IPLD API
