@lidel
-   Done:
    -   Fixed some bugs and released IPFS Companion Beta:[v2.6.3.12520](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/releases/tag/v2.6.3.12520) 
        -   Ships with window.ipfs.enable ‚Äì feedback welcome in[#619](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/pull/619) 
    -   Proposal to enable Gateway on localhost IPv6 ‚Äì[go-ipfs/issues/5905](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/5905) 
    -   Created shared Glossary for all IPFS project on Transifex (<https://docs.transifex.com/setup/glossary>), the goal is to reuse the same translation for key terms across all projects (compliments shared translation memory).
    -   Some meetings related to team growth
-   Blocked:
    -   ‚ÄúAdd files‚Äù regression in latest[ipfs-webui/issues/928](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-webui/issues/928#issuecomment-452507734)

    -   Copy/paste shortcuts fixed on macOS: https&#x3A;//github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop/pull/770
    -   Researched about binary signing for Windows. Sent an email to IT team. Soon, we‚Äôll have signed Windows binaries.
    -   Released v0.6.1 of Desktop (<https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop/releases/tag/v0.6.1>)
        -   Auto-update worked for me! Yey! Although it didn‚Äôt work for everyone (<https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop/issues/783>) ü§Ø
    -   Research Windows Context Menu extensions (<https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop/issues/678#issuecomment-451994682>) and we decided to add it as a top-level menu.

    -   Look at libp2p browser tests

**Discussion Highlights**

_Discussion highlights and additional notes._

- @lidel: Does ipv6 [look](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/157609/50833266-eb72ee00-1350-11e9-9c24-33399eda7c83.png) better, or is it just shorter? :)
- @olizilla: Preview of self-hosted opt-in analytics, emphasis on respecting user privacy 
- @fsdiogo: Web UI: interesting problem: how to tell if dragged&dropped item is a file or a folder? - [ipfs-webui/pull/931](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-webui/pull/931) 
- @hugomrdias
  - Status update about reducing bundle size across multiple projects
  - Default transport of go-ipfs and js-ipfs will move towards QUIC, and mplex module will be basicallty only for the browser. 
    - Q: We should think about the future: who will be responsible for maintenance?
    - A: It remains a key part of libp2p stack, IPFS is only one of many libp2p clients that run in the browser (eg. MetaMask), but we should spend some time to help with dev if needed. 
  - We should take a look at browser-related tests in https://github.com/ipfs/benchmarks

**Guest Demo: PPWA with APSW**

@gozala talked about his experiments with Progressive Peer-to-peer Web Applications (PPWA)

It starts [00:30:21](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeialvp3az23urfzwpfmaiopkd42t3gvpai6t2ozl3lf2l5ghgsvtby/2019-01-09%2017.05.42%20GUI%20and%20In%20Web%20Browsers%20Weekly%20833247793/zoom_0.mp4#t=00:30:21)

Context about PPWA: <https://via.hypothes.is/https://gozala.hashbase.io/posts/Native%20talk.html>   
Repository with PPWA PoC: <https://github.com/Gozala/lunet/> 

-   Idea behind PPWA: static sites use Service Workers and Iframes to enable IPFS experience and improve offline mode
    -   How to pick the best IPFS backend at hand in a way that works in vanilla browser?
    -   How to reach ipfs-desktop node from browser without installing ipfs-companion and setting up new CORS rules?
    -   Service worker-based access points!
        - Access Point Service Worker (APSW)
        - Companion Service Worker (CSW)
        - CSW talks to APSW iframe over `MessagePort`
        - Details: [lunet/#overview](https://github.com/Gozala/lunet/#overview)
- <https://lunet.link>  is a static site published to Github Pages, it installs service worker and also serves as iframe API endpoint
    - Maximizing ease of use: a single `importScripts` to set up APSW orchestration and `<meta>` + `<script>`  tags to define "dapp mount point"
-   Demo: IPFS Web UI loaded via APSW
-   Demo: Peerdium via APSW - publishing encrypted payload to IPFS
-   Challenge: HTTPS on localhost (Firefox has own keystore etc)
-   Challenge: how to keep service worker alive?
    -   Firefox terminates service worker (workaround possible with web page cooperation)
    -   Issues in Safari and Firefox (Service Worker)
-   Demo works on Safari on iPhone
-   Future: more endpoints, more ‚Äúsinks‚Äù, better performance, ensure it works by default
-   Textile threads are interesting way of delivering ‚ÄúFollow‚Äù/‚ÄúSync‚Äù primitives
-   Longer vision: sites can access social data without downloading it all
