### Notes

- write-file-atomic causing issues. nearform work is in progress to replace it.
- Andrew is updating the package managers ecosystem spreadsheet. It might not stay a spreedsheet forever, as it feels like a 4d problem space.
- Action: we need more folks to try npm-on-ipfs, for feedback / see the pain points
- Action: start a doc / list of capabilities that we know we need already to do a good job of integrating with package managers, to help focus other working groups
- Action: What are the talking points and exciting ideas in using IPFS for package-managers... Can we publish some interesting blog posts on these ideas
  - Rabin chunker on expanded tarballs may not be better than storing packed tarballs
    - https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-npm-registry-mirror/issues/6
    - our current rabin impl would be easy to improve... we need to dedicate time to it.
  - A story about all the packages a developer downloads and re-downloads over the course of a day / week
  - the npm graveyard, all the modules that got yanked from npm that are still on npm-on-ipfs
- Andrew looking at adapting npm-on-ipfs so that it can be used as a general purpose artefactory-like app that can be used by dev teams.
- Andrew speculating on what happens when multiple folks in a decentralized way fetch parts of an existing registry content.  Reproducible import becomes relevant!
