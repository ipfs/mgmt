### Questions
- Can we add any libraries we create/find for async iterators updates to the async iterator issue to keep track of helpful libraries?
  - Yes, let's do that!

### Cross team updates

- @jimpick (Dynamic Data and Capabilities)
  - experimenting with IPNS on PeerPad pinner
  - excited about dagbuilder ... want to try some different approaches to append only logs
  - want to investigate simulation environment (Testlab?)
  - Adin is working on IPNS ideas
  
- @lidel (UI WG)
  - If you are interested in how we can make the IPFS Companion better, come have a chat in https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/issues/689

### Other notes

- @jacobheun out next Monday (11/03)
- @vmx out next week (Tue - Sat: 2019-03-12/16) at FOSSGIS conference
