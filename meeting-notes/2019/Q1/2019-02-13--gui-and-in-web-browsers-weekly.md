**Discussion Highlights**

_Discussion highlights and additional notes._

-   __lidel:__ found a way to provide Origin-based isolation for local IPFS2HTTP gateway: [go-ipfs/issues/5982](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/5982)
    -   **tl;dr** this will enable us to support URLs like `http://bafybeif57ylbap2tuqrl7nb25y7hxlncm2ebjd74u4ck2hpmljitylmxc4.ipfs.localhost` and `http://docs.ipfs.io.ipns.localhost`
-   __Diogo:__ making various listings in Web UI much more efficient
-   __Henrique:__ certificate for ipfs-desktop binary on Windows (removes security warning)
-   __Oli:__
    -   Please check OKRs and fill your mid-quarter scoring
        -   GUI:<https://github.com/ipfs/team-mgmt/pull/808> 
        -   In Web Browsers:<https://github.com/ipfs/team-mgmt/pull/804> 
    -   Analytics for ipfs-webui are coming  
        (DNT header + self-hosted instance of[countly](https://count.ly))
    -   FYI there is<https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-css> which includes not only CSS, but also SVG icons :-)
-   __Teri:__ The WIP PR for the ProtoSchool file upload I just showed: [https://github.com/ProtoSchool/protoschool.github.io/pull/111](https://github.com/ProtoSchool/protoschool.github.io/pull/111)
-   __Alan:__
    -   DHT landing in js-ipfs \\o/
        -   CPU hog right now, requires additional work on connection managements, but when ready will make embedded js-ipfs in ipfs-companion truly shine!
    -   Fun fact: using go-ipfs with ‚Äòtest‚Äô profile makes tests ~x3 faster
-   __Hugo:__
    -   PSA: CI for our projects is in the process of moving to Travis. Working with infra team to iron the kinks and look into things like daily benchmarks etc.
    -   This is great news, saves a lot of compound time for everyone!
-   __Andrew:__
    -   _npm on IPFS demo_
        -   search for npm package, resolve a CID \\o/
-   __Jim:__
    -   [Bafyplex](https://github.com/jimpick/bafyplex/), [Lunet](https://github.com/Gozala/lunet/) + Logux demo
        - peer-base in iframe pinning demo https://bafybeid7pdb56figg7hv6uxyt4tnovb4zw54vmtqcu2oc6nkzz2mf6r2s4.lunet.v6z.me/
        - logux: useful technique of leader election across all browser tabs for the same Origin
            -   Saves resources, could be useful for vanilla js-ipfs as well
-   We decided to remove Web UI from Companion and load it from IPFS <https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/pull/680>
