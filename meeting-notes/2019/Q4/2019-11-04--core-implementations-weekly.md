## Notes

### Initiatives
> Update or add info on initiatives that are happening

#### Upgraded Release Process
@stebalien / @achingbrain

- js-ipfs 0.40 release issue created
    - https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/2558
    - Repo migration tool, blocked on a PR for this
- Nothing new from go-ipfs    

#### Upgrade Testing Infra/Process
@jimpick / @stebalien / @alanshaw / @daviddias

- The testground team is having a hack week.
- Working on automatically spinning up nodes, trying to spin up lots of DHT nodes
- Working on simulating latency, etc, to better mimic the network

#### Subdomain Gateway (Base32, Origin isolation)
@lidel

- JS land:
    - js-peer-id: addressed review of [feat: support Peer ID represented as CID](https://github.com/libp2p/js-peer-id/pull/105), and it's merged!
    - js-ipfs: redone [feat: js-ipfs support of CIDs in /ipns/ content paths](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/2566) to make it shippable _today_, ready for review/merge

#### Distributed Signaling (js-libp2p)
@jacobheun

- Still on hold pending async/await

#### IPNS (go-ipfs / js-ipfs)
@aschmahmann / @hugomrdias

IPNS-over-PubSub
  - https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-pubsub/pull/184 landed ü•≥
  - go-libp2p-pubsub v0.2.1 released
  - in the process of being integrated into go-libp2p-pubsub-router and then IPFS
  - includes resolving [go-libp2p-pubsub-router#28](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-pubsub-router/issues/28)

#### Add Performance (go-ipfs)
@aschmahmann

Plan is to figure out how to do asynchronous database writes for IPFS Add
Three options:
  - Extend the datastore interface to allow asynchronous writes/flushes [go-datastore#137](https://github.com/ipfs/go-datastore/issues/137)
  - Write/improve our asynchronous writing layer on top of a synchronous database (e.g. the BufferedDAG)
  - Write an asynchronous datastore on top of a synchronous datastore with periodic flushing
  
Currently going to try and improve the BufferedDAG while pushing on the datastore interface improvements

#### Migration to multihash keys in blockstore (js-ipfs)
@alanshaw / @auhau

- IPFS repo migrator tool integration into ipfs-repo PR in progress
  - https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-repo/pull/202

#### IPFS Mount
@djdv

- No update

#### Bitswap Updates
@dirkmc
  - Working through code reviews for [Bitswap proof-of-concept](https://github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap/pull/189)
    - [Reviews and changes to go-peertaskqueue](https://github.com/ipfs/go-peertaskqueue/pull/8)
  - [Test plans](https://github.com/ipfs/testground/issues/79) for Bitswap in testground
  - Parallel reads PR merged and deployed to cluster.
    - Shows significant (2x?) improvement in throughput for fetching filecoin proof parameters.

#### js-ipfs/js-libp2p/js-ipld async await refactor
@achingbrain / @jacobheun / @vasco-santos / @alanshaw

  - Identify refactor underway [js-libp2p#473](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/pull/473) 
    - This will also include support for the [Identify Push protocol](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/tree/master/identify#identifypush)
  - Circuit Relay and Discovery refactors are next on the list

### Design Review Proposals
> You want to propose something for design review.

- @alanshaw: (pre-review) Proposal for uniting the files APIs
    - https://github.com/ipfs/interface-js-ipfs-core/blob/feat/unite-the-files-apis/SPEC/FILESv2.md
- @achingbrain: Proposal for improving the HTTP API (streaming, error handling, general conventions)
  - https://github.com/ipfs/specs/pull/224, please get involved!

### Blockers/Asks
> You are blocked and need to talk about it to help unblock. List it here!
  
### Questions
> You have questions and need them answered. List them here.

### Parking Lot
> Anything you would like to discuss that doesn't fit into any of the other categories.

- Someone brought up an issue about adding large amounts of data and it creating memory leaks (go-ipfs)
  - We might have something that's keeping pointers to things open
  - Creating a nil repo, and it's not getting closed! Might be a 1 line fix

### Week Update (for async review)
> Only post updates that are relevant to the IPFS Core Implementations Work. We know you do a ton more things but for this call, the focus are the implementations ‚ù§Ô∏è üåü
