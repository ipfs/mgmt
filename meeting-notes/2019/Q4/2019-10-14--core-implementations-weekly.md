## Notes

### Initiatives
> Update or add info on initiatives that are happening

#### Upgrade Release Process
@stebalien / @achingbrain

- js-IPFS added automated tests for examples
  - Runs on every push to a release branch. Might add this to PRs in the future
  - https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/2536
- 0.38.0-rc0 published
  - Need to run tests for external repos (early testers and other dependents)
    - Will be able to run tests against branches of external repos
- Some fixes to block rm required
  - https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/2531
  - Blocked by: https://github.com/daviddias/pull-ndjson/pull/3
- Is the release process too short? [js-ipfs#2525](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/2525)

#### Upgrade Testing Infra/Process
@jimpick / @stebalien / @alanshaw / @daviddias

- No update

#### Subdomain Gateway (Base32, Origin isolation)
@lidel

- No update. Will pick this up when I clear my plate. If someone wants to work on this it should be fairly simple.
  - https://github.com/libp2p/specs/issues/216

#### Distributed Signaling (js-libp2p)
@jacobheun

- Still on hold pending async/await refactor

#### IPNS (go-ipfs / js-ipfs)
@aschmahmann / @hugomrdias

- No update

#### Migration to multihash keys in blockstore (js-ipfs)
@alanshaw / @auhau

- Repo migration tool is almost merged
- If we use multihash keys we lose ipld codecs, need to solve this
    - Please comment: https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/2522

#### IPFS Mount
@djdv

- No update

#### Bitswap Updates
@dirkmc

- [Proof of concept](https://github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap/pull/189) transfers are fast and consistent, but it's sending duplicate data. Working on resolving this.
  - Need to get testing infrastructure setup to better model the live network (current test environment is low latency)

#### js-ipfs/js-libp2p/js-ipld async await refactor
@achingbrain / @jacobheun / @vasco-santos

  - Pubsub refactor is in progress
  - The Dialer/Upgrader refactor should be done this week
  - Working through some issues refactoring websocket-star

### Design Review Proposals
> You want to propose something for design review.

- This week:
  - @lidel: [exploring "lazy" website cohosting](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/cohosting/issues/6)
- Last week:
  - [Experimental SPEC for MFS-based cohosting](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/cohosting) is looking for feedback. It is an exploration around simple tools and conventions for cohosting existing websites with IPFS
  - unixfsv1.5: @stebalien is still the DRI for writing this up.

### Blockers/Asks
> You are blocked and need to talk about it to help unblock. List it here!

- @daviddias https://github.com/daviddias/pull-ndjson/pull/3

### Questions
> You have questions and need them answered. List them here.

### Parking Lot
> Anything you would like to discuss that doesn't fit into any of the other categories.

@alanshaw - Help me test this side project thing! It's in celebration of gossipsub being released in JS IPFS. Install it and lets chat!
- https://github.com/alanshaw/chatterbox-webext
