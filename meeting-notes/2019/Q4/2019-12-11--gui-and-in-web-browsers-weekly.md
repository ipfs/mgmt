## Agenda

- Changes coming to ipfs-companion: 
    - [improved experience on DNSLink websites](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/pull/826)
        - we stopped DNSLink redirect as an experiment in one Beta release, see [here](https://github.com/ipfs/docs/issues/405#issuecomment-562789534) for a wider background 
    - [keeping DNSLink redirect to local gateway](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/pull/831)
        - decided keep old behavior as the default, but user can now disable redirect of DNSLink websites via Preferences
    - [disable integrations per website](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/pull/830) (feedback welcome!)
        - made it easier to enable/disable IPFS on a specific website
    - [Chrome Web Store Removal notification for IPFS Companion Beta](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/issues/832)
        - Google is "hardening" automated checks on their store, slowing down our release process
        - If you want to get the latest version, consider switching to Firefox
        - Chrome version is usually one or two weeks behind :(

        - optimized flow for orchestration of multiple nodes
        - fixed use in browser contexts
            - a lot of previously skipped tests are now possible \o/
            - only scenario that does not work atm is two browser nodes
