## Notes

### Initiatives
> Update or add info on initiatives that are happening

#### Upgraded Release Process
@stebalien / @achingbrain
- Actually testing third party repos
  - Some of these are using ipfsd-ctl instead of js-ipfs directly
    - Hoping to get people to migrate towards using specific versions of js-ipfs

#### Upgrade Testing Infra/Process
@jimpick / @stebalien / @alanshaw / @daviddias
- @jimpick demo - Testground + Docker https://github.com/ipfs/testground/pull/74
- ipfs/benchmarks down - on Alan's list to get this working again (and ensure permissions are shared more broadly)
- @hugomrdias all js-interface-core tests run and pass in the browser https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/2529 
- Testground update (@daviddias)
  - ‚úÖ Refreshed set OKRs based on feedback from Molly https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VeyiLvBdX_PrP394kU_lwkQZxfNwqMVX1f7K4ursSPM/edit#gid=96566767
  - ‚öôÔ∏è ROADMAP in progress https://github.com/ipfs/testground/pull/75
  - ‚úÖ smlbench Plan now works with the TestGround Orchestrator (means that we have a good way to spawn ipfs daemons using IPTB) https://github.com/ipfs/testground/pull/60
  - ‚úÖ  go-ipfs as a Library Tutorial complete (means that we have a good template on how to spawn ipfs nodes in process) https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/6695
  - ‚öôÔ∏è smlbench with 2 separate containers is working and files are being transferred (this is the base for Test Plan 2 which is about testing Bitswap/GraphSync) https://github.com/ipfs/testground/pull/74
  - ‚úÖ Our Starchitect, Raul, is back this week!
  - ‚ÑπÔ∏è If you want to follow this and more progress, check out the Kanban https://trello.com/b/O9z3ljaH/testground-ignition-%F0%9F%9A%80


#### Subdomain Gateway (Base32, Origin isolation)
@lidel

- On hold, should start work on [Peer IDs as CIDs](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/issues/216) (in js-libp2p) this week ü§û
  - Want to ship support + tests for CIDs without defaulting PeerID output to CIDv1Base32 for now, so we can start using them without pulling the plug on the old representation (which is effectively just CIDv0)

#### Distributed Signaling (js-libp2p)
@jacobheun

- Still on hold pending async/await

#### IPNS (go-ipfs / js-ipfs)
@aschmahmann / @hugomrdias
- Adin is out for holiday

@hugomrdias
  - Talked a lot about ipns over dns at Diffusion 2019 Berlin this weekend and at least one group from fission.codes wants to help out and be involved to get this done.
  - spec for ipns over DNS blocked behind testing work

#### Migration to multihash keys in blockstore (js-ipfs)
@alanshaw / @auhau

- The PR to implement this has been merged. Some feedback from that is being implemented in a follow up PR.
  - We'll then have the ability to migrate repos across versions which will allow us to do things like changing multihashes.
  - Gets us closer to base32 cids by default

#### IPFS Mount
@djdv

 - Iterating on PR feedback - add experimental daemon plugin for 9P2000.L support (https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/6612)
 - trying to iron out ambiguities with plugins, config, etc. (we can do some things multiple ways, how SHOULD we do them? / what can users expect)
 - working on upstream deps (portability concerns in 9P lib, Golang's syscall/unix pkg)
 - writing and debugging tests
 

#### Bitswap Updates
@dirkmc

- [Proof of concept](https://github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap/pull/189)

#### js-ipfs/js-libp2p/js-ipld async await refactor
@achingbrain / @jacobheun / @vasco-santos / @alanshaw

- js-libp2p [trello board](https://trello.com/b/ibz3Ub0a/js-libp2p-async-refactor)
  - [Initial Dialer/Upgrader](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/pull/462) is done
  - Crypto now has [an interface](https://github.com/libp2p/js-interfaces/tree/master/src/crypto)! This is in the brand new, consolidated [js-interfaces repo](https://github.com/libp2p/js-interfaces).
  - All pubsub modules have PRs and reviews have started
    - Integration with `js-libp2p` on the way
    - Creation of `PeerStore` to replace `Peerbook` in this context
  - We're pausing on websocket-star for now. As we get closer to finishing the refactor we may spend the time to just get this replaced, instead of burning more time on it, as we want to sunset it anyway.
- js-ipfs
    - A new JS core API is coming https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/2547
    - Interop and interface-core tests are being ported to async/await by Pedro Santos
    - Tests setup with a new super cool ipfsd-ctl is almost done

### Design Review Proposals
> You want to propose something for design review.

- This week:
- Last week:
  - @lidel: [exploring "lazy" website cohosting](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/cohosting/issues/6)

### Blockers/Asks
> You are blocked and need to talk about it to help unblock. List it here!

@dirkmc pls have a look at this https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-bitswap/pull/203 

We would love for you to give a good review and add any notes and/or questions we might be missing, urls to them are:
‚úÖ =merged üîç=ready for review ‚öôÔ∏è=Draft in Progress (still useful if you can check it out)
- ‚úÖ IPFS Open Problem: Preserve full users' privacy when providing and fetching Content
- üîç IPFS Open Problem: Mutable Data (Naming, Real-Time, Guarantees)
- ‚öôÔ∏è IPFS Open Problem: Human Readable Naming
- ‚öôÔ∏è IPFS Open Problem: Improved layouts to represent data in hash-linked graphs (using IPLD)
- ‚öôÔ∏è IPFS Open Problem: Enhanced Bitswap/GraphSync with more Network Smarts
- üîç libp2p Open Problem: Routing at Scale (1M, 10M, 100M, 1B.. nodes) 
- üîç libp2p Open Problem: PubSub at Scale (1M, 10M, 100M, 1B.. nodes)
- https://github.com/ipfs/research/pulls & https://github.com/libp2p/research/pulls


### Questions
> You have questions and need them answered. List them here.

### Parking Lot
> Anything you would like to discuss that doesn't fit into any of the other categories.

@hugomrdias
- One big feedback from talking with people in Diffusion Berlin 2019 was go-ipfs is hard to install in Linux -- this should be easy to fix, by having a PPA or snap or flat(something) or other way of installing.
