IPNS-over-PubSub
  - [go-libp2p-pubsub-router#37](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-pubsub-router/pull/37) ready for another review round

IPNS-over-DNS
  - Adin and me started working on the spec in Costa Rica will continue in the next weeks
  - @aschmahmann: Currently assuming this is low priority until next year, but if we'd like to prioritize landing the spec please lmk :) 

#### Add Performance (go-ipfs / js-ipfs)
@aschmahmann / @achingbrain

Working on PRs to make datastores support asynchronous writes
  - https://github.com/ipfs/go-datastore/pull/140
     - [go-ds-measure](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ds-measure/pull/23)

@achingbrain parallelizes adding files in js-ipfs in 2 places
  - file and chunking (file import and block write)
  - https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-unixfs-importer/pull/41

#### Migration to multihash keys in blockstore (js-ipfs)
@alanshaw / @auhau

- No progress. On hold due to time constraints.

#### Bitswap Updates
@dirkmc

  - Progress expected this week as we'll be meeting to work specifically on Bitswap

#### js-ipfs/js-libp2p/js-ipld async await refactor
@achingbrain / @jacobheun / @vasco-santos / @alanshaw

- js-libp2p
  - libp2p-secio released and added to js-libp2p tests
  - circuit relay refactor completed in core [js-libp2p#477](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/pull/477)
  - async dht integrated into core [js-libp2p#480](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/pull/480)
  - peer and content routing async integrated into core [js-libp2p#486](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/pull/486)
  - Working on a [Token Dialer](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/pull/490) to support parallel, per peer dials 
  - Working on updating the js-libp2p-daemon to use async so we can run interop tests
  - Looking to do a pre release of the refactor this week. Follow along at [js-libp2p#487](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/issues/487)
    - Will start integrating the pre release into js-ipfs when it's out
    - There will likely be some changes needed, which is why this is a pre release and not an RC.
  - Working on finalizing initial api and usage docs [js-libp2p#472](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/pull/472)
  
- js-ipfs-http-client
    - https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-http-client/pull/1183
    * TLDR;
      * Remove Node.js streams and pull streams
      * Remove callbacks
      * Remove peer-info and peer-id
    * now 92.7KB (was 246KB)
