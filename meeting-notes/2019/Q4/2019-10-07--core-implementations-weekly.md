## Notes


### Initiatives
> Update or add info on initiatives that are happening

#### Upgrade Release Process
@stebalien / @achingbrain

- go-ipfs patch release did not ship, again.

- js-ipfs is on the v0.39.0 release train: https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/2489
  - [x] feat: [Allow daemon to init and start in a single command](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/2428)
  - [x]  fix: [Limit concurrent HTTP requests in browser](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/2304)
  - [x] feat: [Config profiles](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/2165)
  - [x] feat: [Web UI 2.5.4](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/2478)
  - [ ] feat: [Support `block rm` over HTTP API](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/2514)

- No update this week

#### Upgrade Testing Infra/Process

@jimpick / @stebalien / @alanshaw / @daviddias

- [ipfs/testground](https://github.com/ipfs/testground)
- There are some tests being conceptualized and implemented
  - DHT Test being implemented
- Infrastructure progress with AWS and Elasticsearch
  - @jimpick will record a video explaining the flow

#### Subdomain Gateway (Base32, Origin isolation)

@lidel

  - "IPNS in Base32": merged [libp2p RFC 0001](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/pull/209)
    - next step is to implement it ‚Äì tracked in [ibp2p/specs/issues/216](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/issues/216)
  - wrote [browser-addressing intro for docs.ipfs.io](https://github.com/ipfs/docs/pull/298)
  - revistited state of secure-context and `localhost` in Firefox & Chromium ‚Äì [summary here](https://github.com/ipfs/in-web-browsers/issues/109#issuecomment-537061478)


#### Distributed Signaling (js-libp2p)
@jacobheun

- Still on hold pending the js-libp2p async refactor

#### IPNS (go-ipfs / js-ipfs)
@aschmahmann / @hugomrdias

@aschmahmann:
 - PubSub discovery improvements very close to shipping (working with @Stebalien on reviews while he's at DevCon)
 - Next work would be related to factoring namesys out of IPFS and changing the interfaces to support third-party publishing and local pinning of IPNS records
   - Priorities have shifted given that IPNS will no longer be on üî•, likely won't have a ton of time to work on this during Q4
 - If IPNS over DNS spec lands before I can start working on the DHT (blocked by ongoing testground work), I can probably tackle it



#### Migration to multihash keys in blockstore (js-ipfs)
@alanshaw/@auhau


#### IPFS Mount
@djdv

@aschmahmann
- Things are getting progress

#### Bitswap Updates
@dirkmc

- Progress on https://github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap/issues/187
- Performance improvements
  - Parallel reads and research on finding the bottleneck

#### js-ipfs/js-libp2p/js-ipld async await refactor
@achingbrain / @jacobheun / @vasco-santos

- Libp2p: 20/30 Complete! 66%
  - Async modules incompatible with the current version of libp2p have been marked with `beta` tags on npm [js-libp2p#460](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/issues/460). All working versions are `@latest`. If you encounter issues let us know.
  - Modules finished:
    - [js-libp2p-webrtc-direct](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-webrtc-direct/pull/30)
    - [js-libp2p-webrtc-star](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-webrtc-star/pull/183)
  - Libp2p Core refactor is underway
    - Transport subsystem complete
    - Dialer and Upgrader refactor is in progress
  - Pubsub module refactors are also in progress
- Refactoring files api to use async iterator streams
  - https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-http-client/pull/1124
  - https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/2517
  - Related: has ever handling over streamed APIs ever worked in the browser?  Error information is sent in HTTP trailers which browsers don't support.
    - The HTTP-API is very go-ipfs design centric. There are several issues already catalog (for a while), mind adding this to https://github.com/ipfs/specs/issues/208 as well?

### Design Review Proposals
> You want to propose something for design review.

- New:
  - [Experimental SPEC for MFS-based cohosting](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/cohosting) is looking for feedback. It is an exploration around simple tools and conventions for cohosting existing websites with IPFS

- Old:
  - unixfsv1.5: @stebalien is still the DRI for writing this up.

### Blockers/Asks
> You are blocked and need to talk about it to help unblock. List it here!

@aschmahmann: Trying to close https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/6527 and I'm confused by which pins should take priority (https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/2518). It seems like it should be direct/recursive > indirect. Instead we seem to do recursive > indirect > direct.

### Questions
> You have questions and need them answered. List them here.

- @david How to spin a go-ipfs daemon via code similarly to `js-ipfs` and add a file

### Parking Lot
> Anything you would like to discuss that doesn't fit into any of the other categories.

@aschmahmann: Bitswap and PubSub seem like they share some issues to tackle (e.g. this pubsub issue https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-pubsub/issues/206). Wonder if there's a way to help each other out.

### Week Update (for async review)
> Only post updates that are relevant to the IPFS Core Implementations Work. We know you do a ton more things but for this call, the focus are the implementations ‚ù§Ô∏è üåü
