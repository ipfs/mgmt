- Plan for this week
  - Select issues to work on
- Review remaining parking lot topics if there is time left

## Notes

#### Upcoming/Shipped Releases
@stebalien / @achingbrain / @alanshaw

- Pre release of js-ipfs async before Christmas (fingers crossed)
- There are some fixed DHT bugs but don't believe there is an RC pending
- go-ipfs release at some point soon

#### Upgrade Testing Infra/Process
@jimpick / @stebalien / @daviddias

- much of the team is together for the last part of last week, first part of this week
  - testground hacking
  - DHT tests for go-ipfs
  - onboarding Anton
  - Anton is investigating alternate "runners" (eg. Kubernetes)
  - Jim is working on connectivity tests
- Looking to launch a usable version by Wednesday
- Switching away from Docker Swarm to Kubernetes
  - Docker Swarm can't handle the larger number of nodes

#### Subdomain Gateway (Base32, Origin isolation)
@lidel

- Waiting for review of [config options proposal in subdomain GW PR /go-ipfs/pull/6096](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/6096#issuecomment-564939993)
  - All opinions welcome!

#### Distributed Signaling (js-libp2p)
@jacobheun

- On hold awaiting js-libp2p refactor, should kick back off shortly after the new year.

#### IPNS (go-ipfs / js-ipfs)
@aschmahmann / @hugomrdias

IPNS over PubSub
   - IPFS integration https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/6758 üö¢üöÄ
   - Don't worry still plenty of work to be done, but for now other things are higher priority

#### Add Performance (go-ipfs / js-ipfs)
@aschmahmann / @achingbrain

Asynchronous Datastores
   - Blocked awaiting review https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/6785
     - @dirkmc to take a look

#### Migration to multihash keys in blockstore (js-ipfs)
@alanshaw / @auhau

- Blocked on not having time.

#### Bitswap Updates
@dirkmc
- Started work on porting the [bitswap PoC changes](https://github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap/pull/189) to js-bitswap https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-bitswap/pull/203

#### js-ipfs/js-libp2p/js-ipld async await refactor
@achingbrain / @jacobheun / @vasco-santos / @alanshaw

- js-libp2p
  - Got a pre release out the door, libp2p@0.27.0-pre.0
  - Integrated the libp2p pre release into js bitswap [js-ipfs-bitswap/pull/206](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-bitswap/pull/206)
    - Found a few issues that needed to be fixed, but otherwise the migration was fairly straight forward.
    - Released libp2p@0.27.0-pre.1 with these fixes
  - Several PRs for updating all the [libp2p examples](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+examples)
  - Improved the API and Configuration [docs](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/tree/refactor/async-await/doc)
  - Getting started guide is in progress [js-libp2p#514](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/pull/514)
  - Starting integration into js-ipfs [js-ipfs#2680](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/2680)
  - This week we'll be working on js-ipfs integration, bug fixes and cleaning up docs
  - Looking to get a Release Candidate out this week
  
- js-ipfs
  - Many PRs open https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+async%2Fawait+
  - Merging all into master PR https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/2547

      - https://github.com/ipfs/blog/pull/340
  

### Design Review Proposals
> You want to propose something for design review.

@aschmahmann: Provider records using multihashes instead of CIDs (https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-kad-dht/pull/422). It seems like the only thing blocking this is a sense of consensus, let's pick an answer and merge some code!

DHT Provider record is blocked from being merged awaiting consensus on what types of keys the DHT should allow (multihashes, multihashes + CIDs, anything, anything less than 80 bytes, etc.)

@stebalien will put this to the libp2p team with a deadline of when IPFS needs a decision by.

### Blockers/Asks
> You are blocked and need to talk about it to help unblock. List it here!
- Please grade Q4 OKRs! 

### Questions
> You have questions and need them answered. List them here.

### Parking Lot
> Anything you would like to discuss that doesn't fit into any of the other categories.

* go-ipfs has switched from /ipfs to /p2p multiaddrs
  * js-ipfs will switch to using /p2p by default in the upcoming async release
* shipped:
  * [js-ipfsd-ctl v1.0.0](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfsd-ctl/releases/tag/v1.0.0) 
  * [ipfs-companion v2.10.0](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/releases/tag/v2.10.0) (only Firefox for now, Chromium soon)

### Week Update (for async review)
