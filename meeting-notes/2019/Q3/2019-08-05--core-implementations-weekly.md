#### Garbage Collection and Pinning (js-ipfs)
@dirkmc/@alanshaw

Next steps:

1. Final review and merge after 0.37 release
1. Switch to streaming API - mitigates possible out of memory for large data sets
    - @vmx working on bringing in new ipfs-repo?
1. Support for GC on schedule
1. Support for GC on `StorageMax` (and browser storage limits API)


#### Delegated Routing (js-ipfs)
@lidel, @alanshaw, @jacobheun

libp2p modules are ready and working and will be available in js-ipfs 0.37.

Next steps:

1. @alanshaw will look at Gateway API commands PR (to allow it to work with a gateway out of the box)
    - https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/5565

#### Gossipsub (js-libp2p)
@vasco-santos

- [libp2p/js-libp2p#365](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/pull/365) got merged with a release candidate of `js-libp2p`
- need review on [ipfs/js-ipfs#2298](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/2298)
  - gossipsub and new js-libp2p release integration

#### Subdomain Gateway (Base32, Origin isolation)
@lidel

#### Repo Consolidation (js-libp2p)
@jacobheun

#### Distributed Signaling
@jacobheun

#### IPNS
@aschmahmann

- go-libp2p IPNS [PRs](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/issues/6447) on-going
  - if you're interested in how the new persistence protocol we're layering over pubsub works check out [go-libp2p-pubsub-router#33](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-pubsub-router/pull/33)

#### Migration to multihash keys in datastore (js-ipfs)
@alanshaw/@auhau

Next steps: Create issue/proposal for migrating datastore to use multihashes

- Needs solutions/proposals for:
    - `ipfs refs local` which is expected to return CIDs.
    - provider records need to use raw multihashes.
    - bundle keystore migration also

#### Package Managers Updates
@dirkmc

- Bitswap - @dirkmc
  - Lots of work understanding and documenting go-bitswap.
  - Work on improving the algorithms around sessions.

- IPFS add performance
  - Currently on pause (mostly) due to the bitswap work.
  - @achingbrain will look into picking this work up as it looks like it will involve a lot of MFS work.
