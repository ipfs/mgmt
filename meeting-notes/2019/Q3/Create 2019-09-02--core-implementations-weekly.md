Thanks @eric

#### Upgrade Testing Infra/Process
@jimpick / @stebalien / @alanshaw

Next steps:

* @alanshaw review [ipfs/benchmarks#268](https://github.com/ipfs/benchmarks/pull/268)

- jim is adding instrumentation to go-ipfs
- raul has PR for running in a nomad cluster.

#### Garbage Collection and Pinning (js-ipfs)
@alanshaw

- Initial impl of GC merged [ipfs/js-ipfs#2022](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/2022), will be available in [`v0.38`](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/2396)
  - N.B. This is initial impl adding commands to core, CLI and HTTP API. No automatic or periodic collection.

Next steps:

1. Streaming [ipfs/js-ipfs#2266](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/2266)
2. Automatic / periodic collection (TODO: needs tracking issue?)

you gotta call the command. its a first pass.

#### Gossipsub (js-libp2p)
@vasco-santos

- Interop PR merged [libp2p/interop#17](https://github.com/libp2p/interop/pull/17)
- Integration reviewed and pending final tweaks [ipfs/js-ipfs#2298](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/2298)
    - ! Renamed: `--enable-pubsub-experiment` => `--enable-pubsub`

profiling of gossipsub shows that message signing is slow.
but we rely on message signing for security...
we are looking to see if we can upgrade the protocol

!!!enable it by default if it is not experimental!!!

does it do anything if you dont use pubsub?
it would accept incoming messages.

ACTION: @stebalian @alanshaw @vasco-santos FOLLOW UP!


#### Subdomain Gateway (Base32, Origin isolation)
@lidel

- applied suggested changes, PR ready for final review: [RFC 0001: Text Peer Ids as CIDs](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/pull/209)

Please take a look if you are interested in peerIDs as CIDv1 and the new RFC process!

#### Distributed Signaling (js-libp2p)
@jacobheun

#### IPNS (js-ipfs / go-ipfs)
@aschmahmann / 

@hugomrdias
- IPNS over DNS
  - Spec work ongoing, call scheduled for tomorrow to discuss missing pieces.
  - feat: add support for ipns and recursive to ipfs resolve should be finally ready to merge.
    - https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/2297 
  - This week i should start `ipfs dns should use DNS over HTTPS` to support IPNS over DNS
  


#### Migration to multihash keys in blockstore (js-ipfs)
@alanshaw/@auhau

@auhau did some initial analysis in code base for parts that will be affected. Outcome is in [js-ipfs/#2415](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/2415) 

Next steps:

* @alanshaw must review JS IPFS repo migration tool PR [#1](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-repo-migrations/pull/1)
* @alanshaw and @stebalien please provide input to [js-ipfs/#2415](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/2415) 

#### Package Managers Updates
@dirkmc

#### Bitswap Updates
@dirkmc / @stebalien

* Proposal: https://github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap/issues/186
  * PoC implementation: https://github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap/pull/189

#### js-ipfs/js-libp2p/js-ipld async await refactor
@alanshaw

Tracking issue: [js-ipfs#1670](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/1670)

* Trying to land [`addAsyncIterator`](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/2379) in js-ipfs which might [make adding in js-ipfs faster than go-ipfs in some situations](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/pull/2372)!
* Landed browser pubsub in js-ipfs-http-client (switch to `fetch` API and async/await)
  * https://ipfs.io/blog/2019-08-29-pubsub-in-the-browser/
* PR for add with `fetch` is WIP [ipfs/js-ipfs-http-client#1087](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-http-client/pull/1087)
