### Questions

- @jacobheun: Should we move pubsub our of experimental as part of the move to Gossipsub?
  - @vasco-santos: It's a new implementation so maybe we should wait?
  - @jacobheun: I think if we get message signing verification in place we should be able to comfortably move it out of experimental. There may be some bugs, but aside from verification there shouldn't be any major issues doing so.
  - @vasco-santos: Yes, that works.
