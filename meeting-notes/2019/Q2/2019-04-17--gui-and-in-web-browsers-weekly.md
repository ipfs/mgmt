**Discussion Highlights**

_Discussion highlights and additional notes._


-   Dietrich re: IPFS + Filecoin
    -   please share your knowledge with me about which parts of IPFS are used by Filecoin. Email or msg or however you like. Looking for specific repos/components.

-   Dietrich re: language
    -   We talked a lot in Lisbon last month about language for pinning/saving/sharing/etc
    -   We also talked in WB WG about core use-cases: saving, reading, publishing, sharing
    -   Design, development and usage will all benefit from shared language
    -   Let’s do an exercise based on the video Mhz shared ([_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raN4S2B4-vo_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raN4S2B4-vo)_ )_
    -   _Add your language here for these different nouns/verbs in the IPFS project - whatever comes to mind, free form, no restrictions (except the CoC! Keep it appropriate!):[_https://ethercalc.org/pfn2sr40qogi_](https://ethercalc.org/pfn2sr40qogi)_
		-   Provide narrative input on usage and audiences in this survey by @ericronne<https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdEHpIdXYYLAoecc2rl2cSBGRI1SfzdhasM_rPjSKJRV7QxKQ/viewform>
