    -   Formerly of Baidu
    -   Now he’s working on Fintech and edge computing solutions for business
    -   Find him at [daijiale.cn](http://daijiale.cn)
    -   Has been self-learning about IPFS technologies, organizing meetups and writing documentation on working with IPFS
    -   IPFS Developers Meetup in China -- including links to individual topic presentations in Jiale’s deck

        -    held the first one in April 2018 in Beijing; 15 people attended and talked about IPFS on the Chinese CDN market, how to use ngrok to build IPFS gateway, references on IPFS and the ontology blockchain
        -   Second was May 2018 and had 50+ people at bCamp in Beijing, featuring a lot of development pros. Topics: re-encryption to protect your data in IPFS network, architecture of IPFS, why EOS needs a DSN like IPFS, gateways and service workers
        -   Third was August 2018 and had 100+ people at a business incubator at ZOL in Beijing. Topics: if IPFS can be combined with Solid, what libp2p is and how it works, what Filecoin is and what it’s built for

    -   Chinese contributions to IPFS …

        -   Community co-organization: enthusiasts, minors, developers, investors, users
        -   Education sector: technical training teachers and bloggers
        -   Open source code community: tech companies and independent developers -- note that this is the smallest cohort in China
        -   Beijing, Hanzhou, Shanghai, Fuzhou, Shenzhen, Hong Kong, Chengdu all have IPFS contingents
        -   Today there are thousands of IPFS blog entries made by hundreds of chinese bloggers all over the main Chinese network media

    -   ProtoSchool in China is an important thing!
    -   Kevin Wong (@kk3wong) started an IPFS workshop at Hong Kong Baptist University
    -   Getting more and more Chinese independent developers’ contributions on IPFS GitHub -- plus tech company contributions (contrib list from ipfsbit.com)
    -   Some of Jiale’s work:

        -   IPFS-MD wiki, a distributed wiki system with IPFS and markdown
        -   Maze: an end-to-end encryption network box with libp2p: secure encryption, fast transfers
        -   The Angel: a donation platform with IPFS and EOS. All donations are subject to EOS contracts

    -   Jiale’s advice on IPFS and filecoin development in China

        -   Key question: Can we find out more befitting business models for Chinese companies or enthusiasts?
        -   Example: mining is a clear business model
        -   With further development of ProtoSchool and public launch of filecoin, this will happen to some degree on its own, but benefit as well from finding some specific business models/benefits
        -   Ideas:

            -   Make professional education business and official certificates available: this implies something more official and therefore of better business benefit
            -   Hackathon with PL technologies in China
            -   More official community events in Chinese language

    -   Q&A time with Jiale

        -   What do you see as biggest questions for IPFS newcomers?

            -   Generally regarding filecoin and how IPFS can decentralize the Web

        -   How can we help? more documentation translations? More demos? What does your community need in order to grow?

            -   ProtoSchool is a great start. Would be even better if there was more official IPFS communications and tutorials in Chinese -- the Chinese dev community can potentially help translate ProtoSchool materials but having official comms in Chinese would be hugely beneficial

        -   Any concerns that the Chinese Government will attempt to restrict access to the IPFS network?

            -   Yes. Many Chinese developers are concerned about this. IPFS can be blocked by the Great Firewall but we need solutions.

        -   Not using the gateway or DNS, or shifting port numbers --would that help?

            -   Yes，the gateway like [ipfs.io](http://ipfs.io/) domain name was blocked by the great wall, but the UDP/TCP transaction layer was not blocked now . The solution we need is for the situation that what if the great wall want to block this transaction layer later... I haven't try out that
