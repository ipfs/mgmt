- **Lead:** @alanshaw
- **Notetaker:** @dirkmc
- **Attendees:**
  - _attendee names..._
  - @jimpick
  - @vasco-santos
- **Recording:**  https://youtu.be/PrScWS9zZJA

## Agenda

- Ask everyone to put their name into the list of attendees
- Round of updates
  - What have you accomplished since the last Weekly?
  - Were there any blockers? If so, which ones? Is it still blocked? Why?
  - What is the next important thing you should focus on?
- Ask for general questions. Could be things like:
  - I'm stuck with something, I don't know who to ask. Who knows who to ask?
  - Who can help me with xyz?
- Plan this week
  - Select issues to work on
- Review remaining issues if there is time left


## Notes

- Vasco will be working on async/await stuff next
  - Alan suggests we focus on work that will not be blocked by IPFS Camp preparations
  - Volker can help out with code reviews
- Dirk is having an issue with locking and web workers in the Garbage Collection issue
  - Alan suggests checking out mortice to see if there are tests for web workers
- Volker: turns out multistream-select is a thing we use, but multistream is not (even though it has a spec), so probably we can deprecate multistream
- Vasco to add a description of a particular connection handling scenario that he would like feedback for to the interface-connection PR

### Questions

- @dirkmc spent a lot of time increasing timeouts and re-running CI. Would it be very expensive to get CI machines that run the unit tests as fast as a laptop does?
  - Ask Hugo if there is a way to make Travis run tests faster so the timing is comparable to a developer's local machine

### Other notes

- @vmx will be out on Thu 2019-05-30
