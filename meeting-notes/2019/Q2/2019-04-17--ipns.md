## Agenda

1. Start recording
2. Ask everyone to put their name into the list of attendees
3. Ask for a volunteer to take notes
4. Everyone can add items to this agenda for things they would like to discuss

5. Collect list of current proposals/ongoing work (IPFS DNSlink, Cloudflare workers, IPNS-over-DNS, IPNS-over-Pubsub,...)
6. What happens when we have multiple IPNS networks? (i.e. we need to specify ipns:// the protocol)
7. Re-publish what can we do ?

## Notes

- Hugo
  - Investigating short-term solution for IPFS camp where a fast IPNS would support fast IPFS-on-wb-browers and also package manager work
  - doing proof of concepts using cloudflare workers
    - it's distributed because it runs on the edges, but not fully decentralized
    - did it in 1-2 days, easy to do
    - 150ms round trip time to IPNS
    - works like an API, the workers get the requests and either put record in key-value store or you get record from there
    - when put validate record is valid, and then self-certify when get it
    - not much trust of the code running in the workers
    - biggest problem is if workers are blacklisted by cloudflare / removed, hard to replicate the database in other servers (need to change things like http addresses)
    - think can get down to 100ms globally
  - other option is to pick up IPNS over DNS
    - https://github.com/ipfs/RFC/compare/rfc/5-ipns-over-dns
    - think more likely to be accepted by community in the short term
    - RFC made by lars, but when update DNSlink record on your domain, put IPNS record with domain instead of with hash
    - make the "resolve" part mostly done - resolves recursively until finds the IPFS
    - already working in go, still a little more js work
    - publishing a little harder, need an authoritive server for some domain that is attributed to IPNS - then people do IPNS path through that domain until it resolves to an IPFS path
    - could tell people they could deploy on their own servers, config name servers to point to their own servers
    - with DNS already have global infra to rely on so when it works, it's fast
    - "how does DNS figure our which servers are the authoritative ones?"
      - IPFS provides one resolve (ex dweb.link), and if people use hash.dweb.link, know it points to desired thing
      - only have to do this once even when have multiple versions - point the hash.dweb.link 
    - resolver will always listen on a well-known pubsub channel and when publish can go to that pubsub channel to publish updats
      - resolver saves that
      - won't necessarily need a domain for things like package managers because can use ipns path directly (websites need to have domain)
      - important to be able to update directly via IPNS instead of constantly updating the DNS record (risky and doesn't allow things like github previews)
    - DNS is fast to update, but the problem is TTLs, caches, and routers
    - when request bubbles up through the DNS record, will know the authoritive domain is the one in the record
    - republishing is the biggest problem
    - could default to "dweb.link" when not explicitly specified
- Adin
  - IPNS over pubsub - the current issue is it doesn't resolve on the initial hit - have to hit the DHT for initial resolve
    - now want to ask peers directly and they echo it out every now and then
    - working reasonably well, still needs some IPFS plumbing
    - relative to DNS, going to be a little slower because have to do a DHT query to find the people interested in your address
    - faster because don't need quorum, just need a person on the pubsub channel
      - can be mitigated by things like rendezvous
      - instead stores name map to peer id, push to you all the people you're looking for
      - need to hit rendezvous and then the pubsub channel
      - rendezvous not quite done yet, but the non-federated version seems to be closer
    - things run in a couple of seconds, but the DHT adds a level of randomness for benchmarking (rendezvous)
    - think can get around adversarial nodes if enough of them
  - seems like might create more overhead with many many pubsub channels for every website you visit
  - some folks use pre-configured pubsub as a performance improvement over a centralized service (could do the subscription after the first central lookup)
- right now have IPNS over DHT and IPNS over pubsub
  - pubsub currently both published to DHT and pulls from there initially
  - when add more ways to recieve a record, changing what it means to know where to query for default behavior
  - want to be able to expriment, and standardizing this a single prototype will constrain that
  - the DNS service option centralized overhead on our gateways (that are already in pain)
  - being central authority for IPNS take downs a downside - if public gateway blocked then this is broken for the centralized support
  - it dramatically simplifies the infra needed to NOT hit our gateway (easy to point record at own server - not in the DHT)
- what's the plan for something like ipld:// - how would you resolve that?
  - thinking about it as an internal pathing scheme, not how you grab/store the blocks
  - for browser integration, the browser would need to have that configured
  - would prefer to leverage something that was already there
- want to specify the ipns protocol as we add more things
  - like to always have DHT fallback (as last resort)
  - maybe apart from DHT you can pick whatever makes sense from use case?
  - continue discussion in issues
  - the order should be configurable - defining the order won't always fit everyone's use cases (in the short term, DNS is always faster)
  - what do you do with failures/inconsistency with updates
- Republishing
  - unreasonable for people to rerun ipns publish every day for website publishing
  - would a long TTL work? or 3rd party republishable
  - should be able to keep a website alive even if can't publish a new version. should be able to keep the last version alive forever if people care - if you disappear your link to your website shouldn't go stale
  - keeping an old signed record alive should work
    - people publish content with low TTL, and other people who want it to be maintained will just republish to new record with longer ttl - doesn't prevent and just makes more annoying for users who want this
    - in gossipsub can keep republishing, but in DHT you can't
    - problem with setting TTL to infinity: many records in DHT, if trying to prove out freshness don't want the old record also floating around
  - would it make sense for different implementations to have different end of lifes?
    - currently the DHT won't actually support infinite TTL (drops it after 24hrs and doesn't allow republishing)
      - there's a desire for freshness, but maybe we should allow republishing if within the TTL
    - for DNS, infinite TTL would be less of an issue
    - maybe the DHT would just drop them?
AIs:
- Adin: Will start issue in specs repo discussing this - if needed will set up another meeting
