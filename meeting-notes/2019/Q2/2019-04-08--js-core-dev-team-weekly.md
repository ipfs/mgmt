### Questions

### Cross team updates

- Dynamic Data and Capabilities (@jimpick)
    - Last week:
      - Finalize OKRs
      - Start organizing IPNS Tiger Team (Adin + Hugo)
      - "Magic Wormhole" HTTP service
    - This week:
      - "PeerChess" + Magic Wormhole experiment
      - Dig into Testlab
      - peer-base update to newer js-ipfs
    - Upcoming:
      - IPFS Camp prep
      - Molly asked me to look at IPFS API (from an application builder point-of-view)
      
- ProtoSchool (@terichadbourne)
  - Files tutorial in ProtoSchool is progressing!
    - Rescoped to focus exclusively on MFS for two reasons: 
      - feedback that MFS should be considered the beginner content and non-MFS commands (and DAG) should be considered advanced
      - blobs (incl browser file objects) aren't supported by the non-MFS methods (@hugomrdias has an OKR to change that)
    - Lessons on files.write and files.ls drafted, more to come
    - See WIP PR at: https://github.com/ProtoSchool/protoschool.github.io/pull/111
### Other notes

(@alanshaw) What should we do with the 0.35 release?
 - @achingbrain: release it with DHT disabled
 - Consensus on doing the 0.35 release with DHT disabled!
