### Questions

- Can we have the delegated routing nodes not enabled by default yet, since they are using the preload nodes?
  - Yes! We can make it so that if no Delegate addresses are specified in the config, we don't enable it. This will allow users to configure delegates as needed, and hopefully encourage people to run their own delegate nodes.

### Cross team updates

None.
