**Team Updates**

**@terichadbourne**

-   Done

    -   Added ProtoSchool chapters in Hangzhou, China and Taipei, Taiwan.
    -   Published ProtoSchool [roadmap](https://github.com/ProtoSchool/roadmap#protoschool-roadmap) and [Q2 OKRs](https://github.com/ProtoSchool/roadmap/blob/master/okrs/2019-q2.md)
    -   Attended planning meeting of the IPFS GUI working group, which will be helping with some ProtoSchool work in Q2
    -   ProtoSchool UX:

        -   Social cards now work thanks to metatags <https://github.com/ProtoSchool/protoschool.github.io/pull/192>
        -   The project structure now creates landing pages for each tutorial and makes it easier to add new tutorials thanks to @fsdiogo <https://github.com/ProtoSchool/protoschool.github.io/pull/180>

-   In Progress

    -   Files tutorial in ProtoSchool is progressing!

        -   Rescoped to focus exclusively on MFS for two reasons:

            -   feedback that MFS should be considered the beginner content and non-MFS commands (and DAG) should be considered advanced
            -   blobs (incl browser file objects) aren't supported by the non-MFS methods (@hugomrdias has an OKR to change that)

        -   Lessons on files.write, files.ls, files.mkdir drafted, more to come
        -   @fsdiogo is exploring options for overriding IPFS-generated errors to provide more customized error messages
        -   See WIP PR at: <https://github.com/ProtoSchool/protoschool.github.io/pull/111>

-   Next

    -   Offline Camp launch
    -   More MFS lessons for ProtoSchool
    -   Better instructions for tutorial authors
