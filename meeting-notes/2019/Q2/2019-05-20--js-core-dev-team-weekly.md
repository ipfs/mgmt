### Questions
- What is the relation of AutoNat to Identify?
  - AutoNat is a protocol for connected peers to help each other determine their NAT status, along with their addresses. This allows nodes to leverage their peers to automatically discover their NAT addresses. If a node is able to learn a new address for itself it can use the Identify Push protocol to let all peers connected to it, that it has a new/updated set of addresses.
- Is AutoNat run as a centralized service?
  - No. Any node can run the AutoNat protocol, so as long as a node has peers that know the protocol, it can leverage them.

### Cross team updates
