    -   ipfs-companion:
        -   [i18n: added pt_BR locale](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/pull/708)
        -   [Release planning around changes in incognito mode](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/pull/705)
        -   [Fix: ‚Äúinvalid signature: 0x80014‚Äù in the tool we use for updating manifest of self-hosted Firefox Beta channel](https://github.com/mi-g/firefox-addons-add-update-version/pull/1)
        -   [Fix: connecting to API over HTTPS after upgrading to 2.8.0](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/issues/706)
            -   Bugfix releases:[v2.8.0.770](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/releases/tag/v2.8.0.770) (Beta) &[v2.8.1](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/releases/tag/v2.8.1) (Stable)
            -   Fixing API over HTTPS in: ipfs-webui / js-ipfs-http-client / ipfs-redux-bundle
                -   [Web UI: Can't connect to API over HTTPS](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-webui/issues/989)
                -   [Fix support for /https multiaddrs passed to constructor](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-http-client/pull/965) 
                -   [Fix support for /https multiaddrs passed via localStorage](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-redux-bundle/pull/25) 
    -   ipfs-companion for Brave:
        -   Detailed update on Embedded Gateway in [ipfs-companion/issues/664](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/issues/664#issuecomment-481697875), tl;dr is:
            -   Companion UI is now aware of embedded Gateway
            -   Feature-detection of chrome.sockets works at runtime
            -   Web UI works!
            -   Identified some blockers, fixes for most of them are already wip
-   Blocked:
    -   ipfs-companion for Brave:
        -   _Content discovery_ with bootstrap nodes alone is pretty bad, especially when preload nodes are under load and slow to respond
        -   _DNSLink websites_(e.g. /ipns/docs.ipfs.io/) are not supported by js-ipfs yet (tracked in[ ipfs/js-ipfs#1918](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/1918))
        -   _HAMT-sharded directories_(e.g. /ipfs/QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco/wiki/) do not work with js-ipfs (tracked in[ ipfs/js-ipfs#1963](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/1963))
-   Next:
    -   ipfs-companion for Brave:
        -   Investigate ways we can improve content discovery (relays, webrtc/stardust signaling, or maybe p2p transport will ‚Äújust work‚Äù with existing polyfills)
        -   Cleanup and PR remaining upstream patches (js-ipfs, hapi, chrome-net)
        -   Sync with Brave on next steps, discuss UX
        -   [Office Hours with Extensions Developer Advocate at Chrome](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/issues/666#issuecomment-478155156)

@terichadbourne

-   Done
    -   Added metatags to make social cards work for ProtoSchool:<https://github.com/ProtoSchool/protoschool.github.io/pull/192> 
    -   Lots of Offline Camp web updates and budgeting. Save the date is here, with actual location announcement, site launch, and applications opening soon:<https://twitter.com/OfflineCamp/status/1115707817816674304> 
    -   Paired up with @fsdiogo on more ProtoSchool UX improvements and merge conflict resolution (see his section above)
    -   Learned how to build React components (for my class)
-   In Progress
    -   Files tutorial in ProtoSchool is progressing!
        -   Rescoped to focus exclusively on MFS for two reasons:
            -   feedback that MFS should be considered the beginner content and non-MFS commands (and DAG) should be considered advanced
            -   blobs (incl browser file objects) aren't supported by the non-MFS methods (@hugomrdias has an OKR to change that)
        -   Lessons on files.write, files.ls, files.mkdir drafted, more to come
        -   Validation challenges because of built-in IPFS errors that are less than helpful (@fsdiogo is exploring how we can hack around that)
        -   See WIP PR at:<https://github.com/ProtoSchool/protoschool.github.io/pull/111> 
-   Next
    -   Offline Camp launch
    -   More MFS lessons
    -   Better instructions for tutorial authors

  


@jessicaschilling

-   Hello!

  


**Discussion Highlights**

_Discussion highlights and additional notes._



Switching CIDv1 from Base58 to Base32

* like js cid problem described by Oli
* but step further
* rn: when adding content, get cidv1 in b58
* everywhere where we say b32 is future, but not in our software
* can we just change it everywhere? removing b58?
* i already opted in! why????
* lidel is wrangler, gets to rattle sabres
* alan maybe have input?
* but he's focused on not letting things catch fire
* this is prep for IPFS camp
* we can say use v1 today
* lidel will create the issues
* this is a documentation and education effort
* stop using b58!
* let's do it and see what happens


Language re pinning:

* next week!


OKRs:

* schedule another meetingggg!!!


Hugo sekret demo:

* echo "will it be fast"
* ipns publish
* ipns resolve...
* less than 10 minutes!
* maybe 100ms...
* ipns over workers
* WAT
* workers is the API
* perfect for browser
* all http requests fast because near end user
* worker saves records on kv store that they have access to
* next: dns
* this is way to do without user running daemon
* self-certifying
* not much trust on cloudflare workers
* next need to convince everyone
* solution in near term
* hard dep on CF will be tough proposition
* not ideal, but works for everyone
* easy to deploy
* no dep on infra team
* easy to maintain
* daemon will try all methods available
* eg over dht, dns, over whatever
* first one wins
* users can opt out or in
* libp2p designed to be configurable
* so can do what makes sense for your app
* ipns not very pluggable now
* but should be
