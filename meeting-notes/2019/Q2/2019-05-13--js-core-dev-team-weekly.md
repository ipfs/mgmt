### Questions

- should we do an iterative non-breaking approach for the async iterators in modules such as the DHT?
  - See the recording for a longer version of the discussion. The short answer is, we'll leave it up to maintainer discression. Some modules, especially those in heavy active development will be difficult to do full async/await changes. Ideally we want to minimize duplication of work where possible, but in some places this may be unavoidable. 

### Cross team updates

@terichadbourne (GUI/ProtoSchool)
- Making good progress on the MFS tutorial for ProtoSchool: https://github.com/ProtoSchool/protoschool.github.io/pull/200
- Available to chat with those building IPFS Camp workshops about whether any part of them makes sense to live on ProtoSchool. Instructions for building tutorials are here: https://github.com/ProtoSchool/protoschool.github.io#developing-tutorials
