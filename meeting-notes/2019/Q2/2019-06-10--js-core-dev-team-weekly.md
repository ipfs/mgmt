## Notes

### Week Update

@jimpick (not attending)

   - Provided some more feedback on IPFS Camp Course C - "Apps" (w/Lidel and Hugo)
   - Testlab
     - got Cole's demo working with virtualbox/vagrant
	 - https://github.com/jimpick/testlab/tree/fork-jim/pubsub_scenario
	 - did Consul tutorial
 - Blocked:

@jacobheun
 - Done:
   - IPFS Camp Course B prep
   - js-libp2p now exports [`createLibp2p`](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p#create-a-node---libp2pcreatelibp2poptions-callback). If you don't care about `PeerInfo` creation, this lets you create a libp2p instance without worrying about it. All other config options are the same.
   - Fixed an issue with [libp2p-switch](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-switch/pull/340). If a blacklisted peer dials you, Switch will now clear the blacklist, it wasn't previously doing this.
     - In the future we will likely move to blacklist management of multiaddrs instead of whole peers to improve the effectiveness of blacklisting.
 - Blocked:
 - Next:
   - IPFS Camp Course B prep
   - Connection prioritization [js-libp2p#369](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/issues/369)
     - Provide the ability to configure "important" peers so that we try to maintain connections with them, and so that connection manager doesn't kill those connections.
