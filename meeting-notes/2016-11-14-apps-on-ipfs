## Agenda

- Orbit update
- "Write-controlled" feeds with orbit-db and ipfs-log
- Berlin hackaton note
- Make this call Orbit specifically.

**You have 30 minutes for this agenda**, 5 minutes before the meeting ends, consider moving the remaining items to a github discussion thread so that all the other sprint meetings can start in time.

## Notes

### Orbit update

* Working on improving documentation about orbit, orbit-db and all the modules all around

Haad went away... And he came back!

* new people contributing! Thanks to all of them
* Looking at the roadmap, might move the product design milestone to after the web version, to push js-ipfs forward

* Hard to demo Orbit today, because of a small number of bugs
* Work is being done on getting a more configurable Orbit, to allow multiple instances on the same computer
* Troubles with connectivity, peers not connecting always with pubsub/floodsub

### Write-controlled feeds

* Prototype for data structures for access control!
* Not really ready but being worked on. 
* find a better name than "write-controlled" (but this is not "Private")

### Berlin hackaton

* Global ethereum hackathon
* Local hackathon in Berlin, for hacking on decentralized applications
* 25th-27th November 2016

### Make this call Orbit specifically

* Most things are about Orbit, while call is supposedly apps on IPFS
* Try to have it as it is currently, if it becomes more crowded, we can rethink

##### After sprint meeting is finished, create the respective action items on the Github sprint issue

* [ ] Figure out how to/if we need to make Orbit easier to demo and use right now 
* [X] Matt to open up issue how we can get more folks into this call https://github.com/ipfs/pm/issues/253
