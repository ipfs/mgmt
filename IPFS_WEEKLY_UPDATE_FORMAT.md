## The dream

For the past couple of months, we have been discussing revamping the IPFS Weekly Update meetings (formerly known as the IPFS All Hands Call). If you want more context, please see this issue https://github.com/ipfs/pm/issues/636.

We want the IPFS Weekly Update to act as a space where we can showcase all of our hard work and game-changing projects. These meetings give viewers a taste of some of the problems we are tackling.


## What's in it for you? üò∫

The main purpose of the IPFS Weekly Update call is to highlight the most exciting work in the broader IPFS community and disseminate high-value knowledge to the many teams improving IPFS, building on top of it, or doing relevant research. You can use these weekly calls to:

1. Attract skilled contributors to your project

2. Motivate the community about adding support for a new feature

3. Find new partners, capabilities, or challenges for your project to work on/with

4. Practice speaking in front of a captivated audience


## The format

The 30-minute IPFS Weekly Update takes place weekly on Mondays at:

9:00 PST |  **17:00 UTC
** | 18:00  CET

Each week's call will feature one or more short talks from guest presenters, in one of the following formats:
* One 15-minute talk (3x per month)
* Three 5-minute lightning talks (1x per month)

## Steps to signing up and speaking

1. Write a short blurb about your talk and propose a date, consulting the [calendar of upcoming talks](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XRB2QsPzCPLPOErKvDZfOKK3CMohI9t_QKNdztYMlK0/edit#gid=350755898) to see what dates are available. Email your proposal to portia @ protocol dot ai and you should receive an update about the status of your talk within 24-48 hours.

2. After your talk has been confirmed, prepare slides for your talk. (Depending on your content, you may also want to share a demo.) Your presentation should be approximately 15-20 minutes long, unless you're giving a 5-minute lightning talk.

3. On the day of the talk you will be given a Zoom link. Sign on to Zoom and be prepared to speak after announcements.

4. Two days after you've finished presenting, you'll receive a recording of the call via email. Feel free to help build awareness of IPFS and by sharing the video of your talk on social media!

### Topics that we're looking for:

* Direct work with any of the IPFS APIs (i.e. [go-ipfs](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs), [js-ipfs](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs)

* Technologies that support IPFS, like [IPLD](https://github.com/ipld/js-ipld)

* Applications that are built on top of IPFS, such as [Peer Star App](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/peer-star-app)

* Distributed applications where IPFS is part of the development stack, such as [OpenBazaar](https://openbazaar.org/blog/openbazaar-2018-roadmap/)

* IPFS used to build alternative decentralized applications that [directly address societal problems](https://observer.com/2017/05/turkey-wikipedia-ipfs/))
