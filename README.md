**tl:dr:** We have a **weekly, all-hands call** on Mondays. The time, date and other info for each week's call is announced in [an issue in this repository](https://github.com/ipfs/pm/issues). Propose agenda items for the call by commenting on the issue!

## How We Work

We use a loose agile approach. We deliberately designed a Org wide process that is very flexible, enabling each team to design an internal coordination strategy that suits their project needs, while keeping a baseline for team wide coordination around Roadmapping and [OKRs](OKR)

You can find a list of [`Distributed Teams` resources on tools, decision making, process and more](DISTRIBUTED_TEAMS.md), that we have been gathering, reviewing, discussing and experimenting.

## Synchronous Time

### Weekly IPFS All Hands

- **When:** Every Monday, 5pm UTC. See [calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=ipfs.io_eal36ugu5e75s207gfjcu0ae84@group.calendar.google.com).
- **How:** This takes place synchronously using [Zoom](#zoom).
- **Length:** 30 minutes.

This is a regular and reliable call where everyone who's working on any repository under the IPFS umbrella checks in and has a chance to either call attention to particular items, to make announcements, or to seek discussion of a topic. It's also a way for casual followers to get a high-level update on the pulse of the IPFS projects without having to follow all of the sprint calls. Newcomers are very welcome.

If you are interested in participating, please join us on [Zoom](#zoom).

You can find recordings of the [previous IPFS All Hands on a Youtube playlist on the IPFS channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmAniA6g9D0&list=PLuhRWgmPaHtSGRSHdU9dbsukHKlihZZAe)

This calendar an other IPFS Community calls are tracked on the [IPFS Community Calendar](https://github.com/ipfs/community#calendar)

If you are hosting a call for the first time or interested in learning how to do it, consult the [HOST_A_CALL](HOST_A_CALL.md) guide.

### Working Hours

As the IPFS team is all over the world, we've picked a set of "working hours" during which we can overlap. The hours are:

```
16:00-19:00 Z/UTC daily or
18:00-21:00 CEST daily or
12:00-15:00 EST daily or
09:00-12:00 PDT daily
```

We aim to be available during these hours. Your mileage may vary.

## Tools

### Zoom

We use [Zoom](http://zoom.us/) for our community calls. This allows us to stream directly to YouTube (currently under maintenance), and to have calls with more than 25 users. Zoom may require a download before you are able to join. If you click on a Zoom link to a meeting room, it will automatically suggest the software to download. Please let us know if you have any issues with Zoom.

**Note:** Screen Sharing in Zoom under X11 requires compositor. Users of minimalist tilling window managers (i3, awesome, dwm)  will share a "black screen" by default. The fix is to use third-party compositor, eg. [Compton](https://github.com/chjj/compton).

## Timezone: `UTC`

All of our times are set according to the **UTC** timezone (or should be). This is much easier than adjusting times manually to accommodate different time zones, for a distributed team. If our calendar's location is set to Reykjav√≠k, Iceland, it is because Iceland is always on UTC time. It is recommended that you know your timezone's difference from UTC for ease of scheduling. Sites like http://everytimezone.com can help with this..
