Every last Monday of the month, we will have a show-and-tell where all attendees can contribute demos, new feature walkthroughs, or status updates. The show-and-tell will serve as another way to showcase some of the cool stuff the IPFS community is working on, in a more participatory and real-time manner! ðŸ˜Ž
