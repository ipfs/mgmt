## The Dream

For the past couple of months, we have been discussing revamping the IPFS ALL HANDS meetings. If you want more context, please see this issue https://github.com/ipfs/pm/issues/636.

We want the IPFS hands-on meeting to act as a space where we can showcase all of our hard work and game changing projects.The IPFS meetings give viewers a taste of some of the problems we are tackling.


## What's in it for you? üò∫

The main purpose of the IPFS ALL HANDS CALL is to highlight the most exciting work in the broader IPFS community and disseminate high-value knowledge to the many teams improving IPFS, building on top of it, or doing relevant research. You can use these weekly calls to:

* Building technologies that support IPFS, like [IPLD](https://github.com/ipld/js-ipld)

* Applications such as [Peer Star App](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/peer-star-app) that is built on top of IPFS

* Distributed applications where IPFS is part of the development stack, see [OpenBazaar](https://openbazaar.org/blog/openbazaar-2018-roadmap/)

* IPFS used to build alternative decentralized applications that [directly address societal problems](https://observer.com/2017/05/turkey-wikipedia-ipfs/))
