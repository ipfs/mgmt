## The Dream

For the past couple of months, we have been discussing revamping the IPFS ALL HANDS meetings. If you want more context, please see this issue https://github.com/ipfs/pm/issues/636.

We want the IPFS hands-on meeting to act as a space where we can showcase all of our hard work and game changing projects.The IPFS meetings give viewers a taste of some of the problems we are tackling.


## What's in it for you? üò∫

The main purpose of the IPFS ALL HANDS CALL is to highlight the most exciting work in the broader IPFS community and disseminate high-value knowledge to the many teams improving IPFS, building on top of it, or doing relevant research. You can use these weekly calls to:

1. Attract skilled contributors to your project

2. Motivate the community about adding support for a new feature

3. Find new partners, capabilities, or challenges for your project to work on/with.

4. Practice speaking in front of a captivated audience
