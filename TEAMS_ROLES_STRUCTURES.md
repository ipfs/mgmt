## Description

The IPFS Project is developed by multiple teams from multiple organizations and both intermittent and continuous invidividual contributors. A structure was developed (and continues to evolve) around Working & Research Groups, OKRs, and PM best practices that were designed to support the already large and growing group of people to coordinate among each other at a global scale.

This document presents the the existing teams that emerged and that led to the many of the sucesses within the IPFS project, their structure(namely: Working Groups & Research Groups) and a definition of roles existing in the IPFS org. At the end of this document, you will find pointers to Teams and Projects that have grown to become their own entities, namely: IPLD, libp2p and Multiformats.

## Team Structures

### One line definition

- **Working Group** - A cohesive team with measurable goals for each quarter. A Working Group needs to have a Captain, a set of people commited to it, and entry point repo and Objectives & Key Results defined per Quarter.
- **Research Group** - A set of people focused on exploring a specific vertical and output possible research surveys, tools, experiments, and other types of knowledge that can inform and help the work done by the Working Groups or spark the creation of new Working Groups all together.
- **Tiger Team** - A small, temporary group of people aimed at solving a specific problem or building a particular feature. A tiger team needs a DRI that drives the team's engagement and agenda, and a set of ad hoc communication channels to empower quick iteration amongst teammates.

### Expanded description

**Working Groups**

Working Groups are teams of people that are appointed to research, develop, and deploy work under the working groups' scope. This structure is designed to provide clarity and direction to the project, enabling individual contributors to focus their time and energy on the areas they are most interested.

Each Working Group is free to experiment with setting their own pace, tracking work, and defining priorities. The only requirements are that the Working Group exposes its focus through OKRs to the rest of the org (common interface), that it assigns a Captain, creates an entry point repo and has at least 2 full time contributors dedicated to it.

Each contributor shouldn't carry responsibilities accross multiple working groups. This is not forbidden by any means but it is greatly discouraged as it will prevent the contributor from achieving full focus.

**Research Groups**

A set of people focused on exploring a specific vertical and output possible research surveys, tools, experiments, and other types of knowledge that can inform and help the work done by the Working Groups or spark the creation of new Working Groups all together.

Some great examples from this structure are: research-pubsub which led to the implementation of PubSub by the IPFS/libp2p teams; and research-crdt which lead to the creation of the Dynamic Data & Capabilities Working Group which todays tackles many of the challenges of building DApps on the distributed web.

A Research Group doesn't require a Captain or OKRs to be formed and having individuals that subscribe to multiple Research Groups isn't considered harmful.

> A byproduct of both of these team structures achieves another important goal: making it easier for new users and contributors to subscribe to updates and get ramped up quickly to the current project focus.

**Tiger Teams**

Tiger teams are a small, temporary group of people usually formed to solve a specific problem or build a particularly complex feature. They frequently form when significant iteration/collaboration across team or project boundaries is required to achieve success. Once the objective is achieved, the tiger team dissolves back into their normal working groups.

Some great examples that would likely benefit from a tiger team include: a scoped collaboration between infra, go-ipfs, and Libp2p on a specific issue; a complex and envolved feature on the intersection of IPFS and IPLD; or a specific time-sensitive project involving members of the community, gui, and js-ipfs working groups.

A tiger team has a DRI (directly responsible individual) that drives the team's engagement and agenda. They are responsible for initiating communication channels and ensuring the group has a unified definition of success they drive toward efficiently. Tiger teams interface through a set of temporary ad hoc communication channels (such as an IRC channel, github project, mumble standup, weekly call, email list, slack etc) to empower quick iteration amongst teammates.

## Team Roles

The individual contributors to the IPFS Project and Org often find themselves wearing many hats while performing their day to day tasks or on the projects they are focused on. We enable this by design to make the IPFS Org very permeable and empower each team to find its perfect balance for the challenges they are facing.

### IPFS BDFL

> Benevolent Dictator for Life

Responsibilities include:
- Lead the IPFS Project at a long term Scale
- Represent the IPFS Project to the multitude of communities
- Take responsibility in setting the direction of the project
- Set the key priorities for the project

This role is currently taken by [**Juan Benet**](https://github.com/jbenet), original creator of the IPFS Project.

### IPFS Project Lead

> Captain of the Captains. Analogous to the Captain/Tech Lead in each Working Group.

Responsibilities include:
- Identify unique opportunities for growth and deploying of the Protocol
- Lead direction of the implementation of the protocol (e.g. get IPFS to 1.0.0)
- Lead, write and review specs and documentation
- Curate our participation in external events
- Curate our major internal events (i.e. IPFS Conf, IPFS Camp & Dev Meetings)
- Direct and participate in the design of technical aspects of the protocol
- Align teams to build solutions for IPFS technical challenges

This role is currently taken by [**David Dias**](https://github.com/daviddias/)

### IPFS Project Coordinator

> Master Overseer of Getting Things Done. Analogous to the Technical Project Manager / Project Manager in each Working Group.

Responsibilities include:
- Lead the quarterly planning process (OKRs) and respective retrospectives
- Lead PL IPFS Team and Project WG Meetings
- Design and implement clever systems for team productivity and feedback
- Create support systems and help team members grow in their roles
- Ensure that teams rely on a uniform structure with respective customizations as needed
- Create and maintain the platform for Resource allocation across teams and projects
- Ensure that there is a steady communication flow between teams and individual contributors

This role is currently taken by [**Molly Mackinlay**](https://github.com/momack2)

### Working Group Captain

The Working Group Captain is a champion for the Product and/or Focus Area. They take the lead on writing or guiding the conversation specs, documentation and other artifacts to support the team. The Captain is also the gatekeeper of the Working Group Roadmap and accumlator of the Working Group Knowledge, guiding the group to made good decisions.

Responsibilities include:
- A champion/tech lead for the focus area
- Guide and Gatekeeper of the Working Group Roadmap
- Decision disambiguator for the technical matters of the Working Group

### Working Group Technical Project Manager (TPM)

The Technical Project Manager (sometimes referenced as Project Manager, Program Manager, and cat herder) is a team enabler. They own the Quarterly Planning process including OKRs and Retrospectives. They ensure that the coordination strategy the WG selected is well executed (weekly syncs, taking notes, communicating needs to other WGs).

The Technical Project Manager should also have a role on contributing to the projects the Working Group is tackling and have an understanding of the technical challenges and needs from the team.

Some working groups have the same person playing both the Captain and Technical Project Manager role. This should be limited to situations where the Working Group is nascent or the team is small.

Responsibilities include:
- Team Catalist. Team Productivity and Fun optimizer.
- Coordinator for the Working Group
- Gatekeeper for OKRs
- High speed bridge for coordination with other Working Groups and Partners
