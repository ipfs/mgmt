# Call Times

### Moving Call Times

Occasionally, call times change; normally this is due to events where the main developers can't make the sync. When you change the times:

- Announce one day before
- Post in IRC the day before, and day of
- Post in the old Call issue
- Post in the new Call issue the new call times
- Update the date for the new Call issue to reflect new starting point
- Update the title of the old Call issue to reflect new ending point
- Move the calendar times on the Community calendar
- Notify all endeavor leads // core contributors by message

### Daylight Savings

Daylight Savings happens twice a year. It is very annoying.

When it happens, make sure to update the call times in the Call Issue carefully. Here are some time zones to keep in mind:

- Z / UTC: Doesn't change.
- EST (Winter), EDT (Summer): New York
- GMT (Winter), BST (Summer): London
- CET (Winter), CEST (Summer): Berlin
- PCT (Winter), PDT (Summer): San Francisco

I mention these because invariably I would type "GMT to EST" to check the time zone, when I meant EDT. Know when they happen, and outsource as much of the time zone information as you can to webapps and tools.
